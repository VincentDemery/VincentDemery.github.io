  abstract  = {We study the temporal response of the electric current in an electrolyte under a sudden switch on or switch off of an external electric field of arbitrary magnitude. We use Stochastic Density Functional Theory including hydrodynamic interactions to express the current as a function of the ionic correlations. Assuming small density fluctuations, we linearize the field theory to compute the correlations in the transient regime. We first show that the correlations do not follow the same trajectory when the field is switched on or switched off. Accordingly, the behavior of the current differs in the two cases: it decays exponentially when the field is switched off, but it relaxes algebraically to its stationary value when the field is switched on. This difference is a non-linear effect since an exponential relaxation is recovered in both cases in the weak field limit.},
