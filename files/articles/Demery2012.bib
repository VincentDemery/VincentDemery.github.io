	Abstract = {{Overscreening in the charge distribution of ionic liquids at electrified interfaces is shown to proceed from purely electrostatic and steric interactions in an exactly soluble one-dimensional lattice Coulomb gas model. Being not a mean-field effect, our results suggest that even in higher-dimensional systems the overscreening could be accounted for by a more accurate treatment of the basic lattice Coulomb gas model, that goes beyond the mean-field level of approximation, without any additional interactions.}},
