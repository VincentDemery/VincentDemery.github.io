	Abstract = {{The relevant parameters at the microstructure scale that govern the macroscopic toughness of disordered brittle materials are investigated theoretically. We focus on a crack propagation that is planar and describe it as the motion of an elastic line within a plane with random distribution of toughness. Our study reveals two regimes: in the collective-pinning regime, the macroscopic toughness can be expressed as a function of a few parameters only, namely the average and the standard deviation of the local toughness distribution and the correlation lengths of the heterogeneous toughness field; in the individual-pinning regime, the passage from micro- to macro-scale is more subtle and the full distribution of local toughness is required to be predictive.}},
