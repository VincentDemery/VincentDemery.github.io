	Abstract = {{We describe a tracer in a bath of soft Brownian colloids by a particle coupled to the density field of the other bath particles. From the Dean equation, we derive an exact equation for the evolution of the whole system, and show that the density field evolution can be linearized in the limit of a dense bath. This linearized Dean equation with a tracer taken apart is validated by the reproduction of previous results on the mean-field liquid structure and transport properties. Then, the tracer is submitted to an external force and we compute the density profile around it, its mobility and its diffusion coefficient. Our results exhibit effects such as bias enhanced diffusion that are very similar to those observed in the opposite limit of a hard core lattice gas, indicating the robustness of these effects. Our predictions are successfully tested against Brownian dynamics simulations.}},
