@article{Sharma96,
	abstract = {{The effect of a nontoxic, nonionic block cc-polymeric surface active agent, poloxamer 188, on electroporation of artificial lipid membranes made of azolectin, was investigated. Two different experimental protocols were used in our study: charge pulse and Voltage clamp. For the charge pulse protocol, membranes were pulsed with a 10-mu S rectangular voltage waveform, after which membrane Voltage decay was observed through an external 1-M Ohm resistance. For the voltage clamp protocol the membranes were pulsed with a waveform that consisted of an initial 10-mu s rectangular phase, followed by a negative sloped ramp that decayed to zero in the subsequent 500 mu s. Several parameters characterizing the electroporation process were measured and compared for the control membranes and membranes treated with 1.0 mM poloxamer 188. For both the charge pulse and voltage clamp experiments, the threshold voltage (amplitude of initial rectangular phase) and latency time (time elapsed between the end of rectangular phase and the onset of membrane electroporation) were measured. Membrane conductance (measured 200 mu s after the initial rectangular phase) and rise time (t; the time required for the porated membrane to reach a certain conductance value) were also determined for the voltage clamp experiments, and postelectroporation time constant (PE tau; the time constant for transmembrane Voltage decay after onset of electroporation) for the charge pulse experiments. The charge pulse experiments were performed on 23 membranes with 10 control and 13 poloxamer-treated membranes, and voltage pulse experiments on 49 membranes with 26 control and 23 poloxamer-treated membranes: For both charge pulse and voltage clamp experiments, poloxamer 188-treated membranes exhibited a statistically higher threshold voltage (p = 0.1 and p = 0.06, respectively), and longer latency time (p = 0.04 and p = 0.05, respectively). Also, poloxamer 188-treated membranes were found to have a relatively lower conductance (p = 0.001), longer time required for the porated membrane to reach a certain conductance value (p = 0.05), and longer postelectroporation time constant (p = 0.005). Furthermore, addition of poloxamer 188 was found to reduce the membrane capacitance by similar to 4-8% in 5 min. These findings suggest that poloxamer 188 adsorbs into the lipid bilayers, thereby decreasing their susceptibility to electroporation.}},

	abstract = {{The biological function of transmembrane proteins is closely related to their insertion, which has most often been studied through their lateral mobility. For > 30 years, it has been thought that hardly any information on the size of the diffusing object can be extracted from such experiments. Indeed, the hydrodynamic model developed by Saffman and Delbruck predicts a weak, logarithmic dependence of the diffusion coefficient D with the radius R of the protein. Despite widespread use, its validity has never been thoroughly investigated. To check this model, we measured the diffusion coefficients of various peptides and transmembrane proteins, incorporated into giant unilamellar vesicles of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC) or in model bilayers of tunable thickness. We show in this work that, for several integral proteins spanning a large range of sizes, the diffusion coefficient is strongly linked to the protein dimensions. A heuristic model results in a Stokes-like expression for D, (D proportional to 1/R), which fits literature data as well as ours. Diffusion measurement is then a fast and fruitful method; it allows determining the oligomerization degree of proteins or studying lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions within bilayers.}},

We show that on the mean field or weak coupling level, the charge quadrupole contributes the lowest order modification to the contact value theorem and thus to the intersurface electrostatic interactions. The image effects are non-existent on the mean field level even with multipoles. On the strong coupling level the quadrupoles and higher order multipoles contribute additional terms to the interaction free energy only in the presence of dielectric inhomogeneities. Without them, the monopole is the only multipole that contributes to the strong coupling electrostatics. We explore the consequences of these statements in all their generality.}},

In this high-energy x-ray reflectivity study, the temperature-dependent structures of three ionic liquids with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate anion in contact with a charged sapphire substrate were investigated with submolecular resolution. All three RTILs show strong interfacial layering, starting with a cation layer at the substrate and decaying exponentially into the bulk liquid. The observed decay length and layering period point to an interfacial ordering mechanism, akin to the charge inversion effect, which is suggested to originate from strong correlations between the unscreened ions. The observed layering is expected to be a generic feature of RTILs at charged interfaces.}},

	Abstract = {{The problem of a particle diffusion in a fluctuating scalar field is studied. In contrast to most studies of advection diffusion in random fields, ours analyzes the case where the particle position is also coupled to the dynamics of the field. Physical realizations of this problem are numerous and range from the diffusion of proteins in fluctuating membranes to the diffusion of localized magnetic fields in spin systems. We present exact results for the diffusion constant of particles diffusing in dynamical Gaussian fields in the adiabatic limit, where the field evolution is much faster than the particle diffusion. In addition we compute the diffusion constant perturbatively, in the weak coupling limit, when the interaction of the particle with the field is small, using a Kubo-type relation. Finally we construct a simple toy model which can be solved exactly, and which extrapolates between the adiabatic limit, for fields with rapid dynamics, and the limit where the field is quenched or frozen.}},

The short- and long-time limits of this effective temperature are shown to be consistent with the temperatures estimated from the kinetic energy and Einstein relation, respectively. The transient fluctuation theorem provides still another definition of the temperature, which is shown to coincide with the short-time value of the fluctuation dissipation ratio.}},

	Abstract = {{This book provides a comprehensive account of the modern theory for the dynamical properties of polymer solutions. The theory has undergone dramatic evolution over the last two decades due to the introduction of new methods and concepts that have extended the frontier of theory from dilute<br>solutions in which polymers move independently to concentrated solutions where many polymers converge. Among the properties examined are viscoelasticity, diffusion, dynamic light scattering, and electric birefringence. Nonlinear viscoelasticity is discussed in detail on the basis of molecular<br>dynamical models. The book bridges the gap between classical theory and new developments, creating a consistent picture of polymer solution dynamics over the entire concentration range.}},

	Abstract = {{The Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a fascinating state of matter predicted to occur for particles obeying Bose statistics. Although the BEC has been observed with bosonic atoms in liquid helium and cold gases, the concept is much more general. We here review analogous states, where excitations in magnetic insulators form the BEC. In antiferromagnets, elementary excitations are magnons, quasiparticles with integer spin and Bose statistics. In certain experiments their density can be controlled by an applied magnetic field leading to the formation of a BEC. Furthermore, interactions between the excitations and the interplay with the crystalline lattice produce very rich physics compared with the canonical BEC. Studies of magnon condensation in a growing number of magnetic materials thus provide a unique window into an exciting world of quantum phase transitions and exotic quantum states, with striking parallels to phenomena studied in ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices.}},

Based on a recent study of the structure of the eigenfunctions, we compute the generating function for Z ( x 1 , t ), Z ( x 2 , t ) under a particular decoupling assumption and thereby extend recent results on the one-point generating function of the free energy to two points. It is established that in the long-time limit the fluctuations of the free energy are governed by the two-point distribution of the Airy process, which further supports that the long-time behavior of the KPZ equation is the same as derived previously for lattice growth models.}},

The continuous shape parameter of these distributions is related to the ratio between the force acting on the piston and the force acting on the particles. Gaussian fluctuations are recovered in the strong compression limit, when the effect of the external potential becomes negligible. Consequences for the thermodynamics are also discussed.}},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.}},

The charged species are confined between two interfaces, also defining the dielectric inhomogeneity in the system, bearing constant surface charges. The thermodynamic potential is obtained in a closed form if the Gaussian approximation for the fluctuations around the mean electrostatic potential is used. The formalism embodies the mean field (Poisson-Boltzmann) terms generalized by the presence of image interactions plus the correlation (fluctuation) terms, which give significant correction to the classical expressions for the force between charged interfaces. The numerical results for a counterion-only system with charged surfaces are treated in detail and compared with simulation data.}},

Various methods such as the simulation method, the eigenfunction expansion, numerical integration, the variational method, and the matrix continued-fraction method are discussed. This is the first time that this last method, which is very effective in dealing with simple Fokker-Planck equations having two variables, appears in a textbook. The methods of solution are applied to the statistics of a simple laser model and to Brownian motion in potentials. It is shown that the solution of the equation for Brownian motion in a variety of potentials can be expressed in terms suitable for evaluation on a computer. A supplement is included, containing a short review of new material together with some recent references. The book should be very useful to graduate students in physics, chemical physics, and electrical engineering, and also to research workers in these fields.}},

	Abstract = {{Measurements by a number of different methods of the dielectric constant and loss angle of water and heavy water at three widely separated wavelengths in the region of anomalous dispersion, {$\lambda$}=10 cm., 3 cm., 1.25 cm., are described. Results show that the Debye equations are exactly obeyed, there being a single time of relaxation varying with the temperature; the ratios of the relaxation times of water and heavy water are found to be in quantitative agreement with the ratios of the viscosity over a temperature range, suggesting that the re-orientation mechanism in these liquids is the same as that of viscosity. The value of the activation energy of the re-orientation process is discussed. The value of 5.5 found for the optical dielectric constant gives a reasonable result for the dielectric constant of water on the Onsager theory. This theory is discussed and shown to give a relaxation equation of the Debye type for alternating fields.}},

@article{Nanjundiah1997,
	Abstract = {{Series-stacked, double-layer carbon capacitors are slated to be used in electric vehicles for power management as well as in consumer electronics for memory backup and burst power. Nonaqueous electrolytes are preferred over aqueous electrolytes, since a wider voltage window can be accessed in the former electrolytes, thereby requiring fewer cells in the series stack. However, it has historically been difficult to assess whether the organic solvent and/or the supporting electrolyte determine the anodic limit, We have eliminated this ambiguity by using solvent-free ionic liquids where the source of anodic oxidation may be ascribed to the anion alone. Even though the new ionic liquids manifested high oxidation limits, we found that when used in practical capacitors comprising high-surface-area carbon cloth electrodes, a much lower capacitance (compared to smooth electrodes) was achieved. To understand whether the observed decrease in capacitance I might be due to the microporosity of the carbon cloth electrode or to practical limitation of the device itself, we first measured the differential capacitance (C-dl) at a Hg/1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium imide. The integral capacitance at the Hg interface was then calculated and compared with that of a smooth glassy carbon electrode, a carbon yarn, and a cloth electrode. In addition, the effect of (CF3SO2)(3)C-, (CF3SO2)(2)N-, CF3SO3-, and BF4- on C-dl were interpreted based on existing theories of double-layer structure.}},

Therefore, (i) fracturing systems often display a jerky dynamics, so-called crackling noise, with seemingly random sudden energy release spanning over a broad range of scales, reminiscent of earthquakes; (ii) fracture surfaces exhibit roughness at scales much larger than that of material microstructure. Here, I provide a critical review of experiments and simulations performed in this context, highlighting the existence of universal scaling features, independent of both the material and the loading conditions, reminiscent of critical phenomena. I finally discuss recent stochastic descriptions of crack growth in brittle disordered media that seem to capture qualitatively{---}and sometimes quantitatively{---}these scaling features.}},

We use a variational (Hartree-Fock like) method which shows that replica symmetry is spontaneously broken. A hierarchical breaking of symmetry allows one to take into account the existence of many metastable states for the manifolds, and to recover the results of the Flory scaling arguments for the wandering exponent. This field theoretic derivation of Flory results opens the way to computing corrections to these exponents.}},

@article{Wang2009,
	Abstract = {{We describe experiments using single-particle tracking in which mean-square displacement is simply proportional to time (Fickian), yet the distribution of displacement probability is not Gaussian as should be expected of a classical random walk but, instead, is decidedly exponential for large displacements, the decay length of the exponential being proportional to the square root of time. The first example is when colloidal beads diffuse along linear phospholipid bilayer tubes whose radius is the same as that of the beads. The second is when beads diffuse through entangled F-actin networks, bead radius being less than one-fifth of the actin network mesh size. We explore the relevance to dynamic heterogeneity in trajectory space, which has been extensively discussed regarding glassy systems. Data for the second system might suggest activated diffusion between pores in the entangled F-actin networks, in the same spirit as activated diffusion and exponential tails observed in glassy systems. But the first system shows exceptionally rapid diffusion, nearly as rapid as for identical colloids in free suspension, yet still displaying an exponential probability distribution as in the second system. Thus, although the exponential tail is reminiscent of glassy systems, in fact, these dynamics are exceptionally rapid. We also compare with particle trajectories that are at first subdiffusive but Fickian at the longest measurement times, finding that displacement probability distributions fall onto the same master curve in both regimes. The need is emphasized for experiments, theory, and computer simulation to allow definitive interpretation of this simple and clean exponential probability distribution.}},

@article{Ben-Zion2008,
	Abstract = {{Crustal deformation patterns are affected by multiscale granulation and healing processes associated with phase transitions between continuum and discrete states of rocks. The ongoing continuum-discrete transitions are accompanied by progressive evolution of disordered fault networks to dominant localized fault zones, development of bimaterial interfaces, and increasing dynamic weakening of fault surfaces. Results on individual fault zones point to three general dynamic regimes. The first is associated with broad range of heterogeneities, little dynamic weakening, power law frequency-size statistics, temporal clustering of intermediate and large events, and accelerated seismic release before large earthquakes. The second is associated with relatively uniform localized structures, significant dynamic weakening, characteristic earthquake statistics, and quasi-periodic temporal occurrence of large events without precursory accelerated release. For a range of conditions, the fault zone response can switch back and forth between the foregoing two dynamic regimes. Higher temperature, fluid content, and thickness of sedimentary cover reduce the seismic coupling in a region and change the properties of local earthquake sequences. Brittle regions with high seismic coupling have few foreshocks and long-duration aftershock sequences with high event productivity, whereas more viscous regions with low seismic coupling have increased foreshocks activity and low-productivity aftershock sequences or swarms. The results provide criteria for organizing data in classes associated with different evolutionary stages and different regional conditions. An ability to recognize the dynamic regime of a given fault zone or a region can increase the information content of the data and lead to improved strategies for seismic hazard assessment.}},

	Abstract = {{We study thermal effects at the depinning transition by numerical simulations of driven one-dimensional elastic interfaces in a disordered medium. We find that the velocity of the interface, evaluated at the critical depinning force, can be correctly described with the power law v T {$\psi$} , where {$\psi$} is the thermal exponent. Using the sample-dependent value of the critical force, we precisely evaluate the value of {$\psi$} directly from the temperature dependence of the velocity, obtaining the value {$\psi$}=0.15{$\pm$}0.01. By measuring the structure factor of the interface we show that both the thermally rounded and the T =0 depinning, display the same large-scale geometry, described by an identical divergence of a characteristic length with the velocity {$\xi$}{$\propto$} v {$-$}{$\nu$}/{$\beta$} , where {$\nu$} and {$\beta$} are, respectively, the T =0 correlation and depinning exponents. We discuss the comparison of our results with previous estimates of the thermal exponent and the direct consequences for recent experiments on magnetic domain wall motion in ferromagnetic thin films.}},

	Abstract = {{Dynamic crack propagation drives catastrophic solid failures. In many amorphous brittle materials, sufficiently fast crack growth involves small-scale, high-frequency microcracking damage localized near the crack tip. The ultrafast dynamics of microcrack nucleation, growth, and coalescence is inaccessible experimentally and fast crack propagation was therefore studied only as a macroscale average. Here, we overcome this limitation in polymethylmethacrylate, the archetype of brittle amorphous materials: We reconstruct the complete spatiotemporal microcracking dynamics, with micrometer/nanosecond resolution, through post mortem analysis of the fracture surfaces. We find that all individual microcracks propagate at the same low, load-independent velocity. Collectively, the main effect of microcracks is not to slow down fracture by increasing the energy required for crack propagation, as commonly believed, but on the contrary to boost the macroscale velocity through an acceleration factor selected on geometric grounds. Our results emphasize the key role of damage-related internal variables in the selection of macroscale fracture dynamics.}},

	Abstract = {{The closure dynamics of a pre-equilibrated DNA denaturation bubble is studied using both Brownian dynamics simulations and an analytical approach. The numerical model consists of two semi-flexible interacting single strands (ssDNA) and a bending modulus which depends on the base-pair state, with double-strand DNA (dsDNA) segments being 50 times stiffer than ssDNA ones. For DNA lengths from N =20 to 100 base-pairs (bp) and initial bubble sizes of N {$-$}6{\thinspace}bp, long closure times of 0.1 to 4{\thinspace}{$\mu$}s are found, following a scaling law in N 2.4 . The bubble starts to close by a fast zipping which stops when the bubble reaches a highly bent metastable state of length around 10{\thinspace}bp. The limiting final step to complete closure is controlled by the dsDNA "arms" rotational diffusion, with closure occurring once they are nearly aligned. The central role of chain bending, which cannot be accounted for in one-dimensional models, is thus illuminated.}},

	Abstract = {{Major advances in understanding the plasticity of ice have been made during the past 60 years with the development of studies of the flow of glaciers and, recently, with the analysis of deep ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland. Recent experimental investigations clearly show that the plastic deformation of the ice single crystal and polycrystal is produced by intermittent dislocation bursts triggered by long-range interaction of dislocations. Such dislocation avalanches are associated with the formation of dislocation patterns in the form of slip lines and slip bands, which exhibit long-range correlations and scale invariance. Long-range dislocation interactions appear to play an essential role in primary creep of polycrystals and dynamic recrystallization. The large plastic anisotropy of the ice crystal is at the origin of large strain and stress heterogeneities within grains. The use of full-field approaches is now a compulsory proceeding to model the intracrystalline heterogeneities that develop in polycrystals. Ice is now highly regarded among the materials science community. It is considered a model material for understanding deformation processes of crystalline materials and polycrystal modeling.}},

	Abstract = {{Critical fluctuations are investigated in lipid membranes near miscibility critical points in bilayers composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, chain perdeuterated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. Phase boundaries are mapped over the temperature range from 10{$^\circ$}C to 60{$^\circ$}C by deuterium NMR. Tie-lines and three-phase triangles are evaluated across two-phase and three-phase regions, respectively. In addition, a line of miscibility critical points is identified. NMR resonances are broadened in the vicinity of critical points, and broadening is attributed to increased transverse relaxation rates arising from modulation of chain order with correlation times on a microsecond time scale. We conclude that spectral broadening arises from composition fluctuations in the membrane plane with dimensions of <50 nm and speculate that similar fluctuations are commonly found in cholesterol-containing membranes.}},

Deformation by crystallographic slip occurs in a sequence of intermittent bursts ({'}slip avalanches{'}) with power-law size distribution. In the spatial domain, these avalanches produce characteristic deformation patterns in the form of slip lines and slip bands which exhibit long-range spatial correlations. We propose a generic continuum model which accounts for randomness in the local stress{--}strain relationships as well as for long-range internal stresses that arise from the ensuing plastic strain heterogeneities. The model parameters are related to the local dynamics and interactions of lattice dislocations. The model explains experimental observations on slip avalanches as well as the associated slip and surface pattern morphologies.}},

@article{Davidovitch2011,
	Abstract = {{The buckling and wrinkling of thin films has recently seen a surge of interest among physicists, biologists, mathematicians, and engineers. This activity has been triggered by the growing interest in developing technologies at ever-decreasing scales and the resulting necessity to control the mechanics of tiny structures, as well as by the realization that morphogenetic processes, such as the tissue-shaping instabilities occurring in animal epithelia or plant leaves, often emerge from mechanical instabilities of cell sheets. Although the most basic buckling instability of uniaxially compressed plates was understood by Euler more than two centuries ago, recent experiments on nanometrically thin (ultrathin) films have shown significant deviations from predictions of standard buckling theory. Motivated by this puzzle, we introduce here a theoretical model that allows for a systematic analysis of wrinkling in sheets far from their instability threshold. We focus on the simplest extension of Euler buckling that exhibits wrinkles of finite length{---}a sheet under axisymmetric tensile loads. The first study of this geometry, which is attributed to Lam{\'{e}}, allows us to construct a phase diagram that demonstrates the dramatic variation of wrinkling patterns from near-threshold to far-from-threshold conditions. Theoretical arguments and comparison to experiments show that the thinner the sheet is, the smaller is the compressive load above which the far-from-threshold regime emerges. This observation emphasizes the relevance of our analysis for nanomechanics applications.}},

	Abstract = {{We quantitatively analyzed particle tracking data on insulin granules expressing fluorescent fusion proteins in MIN6 cells to better understand the motions contributing to intracellular transport and, more generally, the means for characterizing systems far from equilibrium. Care was taken to ensure that the statistics reflected intrinsic features of the individual granules rather than details of the measurement and overall cell state. We find anomalous diffusion. Interpreting such data conventionally requires assuming that a process is either ergodic with particles working against fluctuating obstacles (fractional Brownian motion) or nonergodic with a broad distribution of dwell times for traps (continuous-time random walk). However, we find that statistical tests based on these two models give conflicting results. We resolve this issue by introducing a subordinated scheme in which particles in cages with random dwell times undergo correlated motions owing to interactions with a fluctuating environment. We relate this picture to the underlying microtubule structure by imaging in the presence of vinblastine. Our results provide a simple physical picture for how diverse pools of insulin granules and, in turn, biphasic secretion could arise.}},

	Abstract = {{We consider two parallel cyclic Ising chains counter-rotating at a relative velocity v , the motion actually being a succession of discrete steps. There is an in-chain interaction between nearest-neighbor spins and a cross-chain interaction between instantaneously opposite spins. For velocities v > 0 the system, subject to a suitable Markovian dynamics at a temperature T , can reach only a nonequilibrium steady state. This one-dimensional version of a model introduced by Kadau et al was shown by Hucht to undergo, for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2011/04/P04009/jstat388183ieqn1.gif] v=\infty , a para-{~}to ferromagnetic transition, essentially because each chain exerts an effective fluctuating field on the other one. The present study of the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2011/04/P04009/jstat388183ieqn2.gif] v=\infty case determines the consequences of the fluctuations of this field when the system size N is finite. We show that, whereas to leading order the system obeys detailed balancing with respect to an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, the higher-order finite-size corrections violate detailed balancing. Expressions are given to various orders in N {$-$} 1 for the interaction free energy between the chains, the spontaneous magnetization, and the in-chain and cross-chain spin{--}spin correlations. It is shown how finite-size scaling functions may be derived explicitly. This study was motivated by recent work on a two-lane traffic problem in which a similar phase transition was found.}},

	Abstract = {{The critical point hypothesis for fracture is tested using a progressive damage model. The advantage of the present model, based on continuum mechanics, is the possibility of tracking the approach to final failure in terms either of discrete events (the avalanches) or of the resulting continuous strain field. Different but actually closely linked phenomena are reported. In terms of damage avalanches, power law distributions of avalanche sizes and energies are observed associated with a finite size scaling. The finite size scaling is also observed for the spatial correlations of damage events. A divergence of the correlation length is reported in the vicinity of final failure, from a correlation analysis of discrete events and from a scaling analysis of the continuous strain rate field. We also show that multifractal properties of the deformation emerge from the long-range elastic interactions that occur near final failure. All of these results argue for a critical point interpretation of failure. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the criticality of fracture and deformation of geophysical objects, and for associated precursory phenomena.}},

The major feature is that the spatial white noise for this system appears not additively but multiplicatively.

The steady state for the density function may, however, still be recovered formally as a functional integral over the coursed grained free energy of the system as in models A and B.}},

	Abstract = {{Systems with conserved currents driven by reservoirs at the boundaries offer an opportunity for a general analytic study that is unparalleled in more general out-of-equilibrium systems. The evolution of coarse-grained variables is governed by stochastic hydrodynamic equations in the limit of small noise. As such it is amenable to a treatment formally equal to the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics, which reduces the problem of finding the full distribution functions to the solution of a set of Hamiltonian equations. It is in general not possible to solve such equations explicitly, but for an interesting set of problems (the driven symmetric exclusion process and the Kipnis{--}Marchioro{--}Presutti model) it can be done by a sequence of remarkable changes of variables. We show that at the bottom of this {'}miracle{'} is the surprising fact that these models can be taken through a non-local transformation into isolated systems satisfying detailed balance, with probability distribution given by the Gibbs{--}Boltzmann measure. This procedure can in fact also be used to obtain an elegant solution of the much simpler problem of non-interacting particles diffusing in a one-dimensional potential, again using a transformation that maps the driven problem into an undriven one.}},

	Abstract = {{We present a new time-dependent density functional approach for studying the relaxational dynamics of an assembly of interacting particles, subject to thermal noise. Starting from the Langevin stochastic equations of motion for the velocities of the particles, we are able by means of an approximate closure to derive a self-consistent deterministic equation for the temporal evolution of the average particle density. The closure is equivalent to assuming that the equal-time two-point correlation function out of equilibrium has the same properties as its equilibrium version. The changes over time of the density depend on the functional derivatives of the grand canonical free-energy functional F [ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/common/rho.gif] rho ] of the system. In order to assess the validity of our approach, we performed a comparison between the Langevin dynamics and the dynamic density functional method for a one-dimensional hard-rod system in three relevant cases and found remarkable agreement. In addition, we consider the case where one is forced to use an approximate form of F [ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/common/rho.gif] rho ].}},

Analytical results show that for attractive long-range potentials the steady state is always a precipitate containing one or several clusters of small size. For arbitrary potential, linear stability analysis allows the statement of the conditions under which the uniform equilibrium state is unstable against small perturbations and, via the Einstein relation, definition of a critical temperature T c separating the two phases, uniform and precipitate. The corresponding phase diagram turns out to be strongly dependent on the pair-potential. In addition, numerical calculations reveal that the transition is hysteretic. We finally discuss the dynamics of relaxation for the uniform state suddenly cooled below T c .}},

@article{Andreanov2006b,
	Abstract = {{We analyse the symmetries and the self-consistent perturbative approaches of dynamical field theories for glass-forming liquids. In particular, we focus on the time-reversal symmetry, which is crucial to obtain fluctuation{--}dissipation relations (FDRs). Previous field theoretical treatment violated this symmetry, whereas others pointed out that constructing symmetry-preserving perturbation theories is a crucial and open issue. In this work we solve this problem and then apply our results to the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT). We show that in the context of dynamical field theories for glass-forming liquids time-reversal symmetry is expressed as a nonlinear field transformation that leaves the action invariant. Because of this nonlinearity, standard perturbation theories generically do not preserve time-reversal symmetry and in particular fluctuation{--}dissipation relations. We show how one can cure this problem and set up symmetry preserving perturbation theories by introducing some auxiliary fields. As an outcome we obtain Schwinger{--}Dyson dynamical equations that automatically preserve FDR and that serve as a basis for carrying out symmetry-preserving approximations. We apply our results to the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition, revisiting previous field theory derivations of MCT equations and showing that they generically violate FDR. We obtain symmetry-preserving mode-coupling equations and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, we show, contrary to previous works, that the structure of the dynamic equations is such that the ideal glass transition is not cut off at any finite order of perturbation theory, even in the presence of coupling between current and density. The opposite results found in previous field theoretical works, such as the ones based on nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, were only due to an incorrect treatment of time-reversal symmetry.}},

	Abstract = {{When a thin sheet is crushed into a small three-dimensional volume, it invariably forms a structure with a low volume fraction but high resistance to further compression. Being a far-from-equilibrium process, forced crumpling is not necessarily amenable to a statistical description in which the parameters of the initially flat sheet and the final confinement fully specify the resulting crumpled state. Instead, the internal geometry and mechanical properties of the crumpled ball may reflect the history of its preparation. Our X-ray microtomography experiments reveal that the internal three-dimensional geometry of a crumpled ball is in many respects isotropic and homogeneous. In these respects, crumpling recapitulates other classic nonequilibrium problems such as turbulence, where a system driven by long-wavelength, low-symmetry, forcing shows only rather subtle fingerprints of the forcing mechanism. However, we find local nematic ordering of the sheet into parallel stacks. The layering proceeds radially inward from the outer surface. The extent of this layering increases with the volume fraction, or degree of compression.}},

	Abstract = {{The crumpling of a piece of paper leaves permanent scars, showing a focusing of the stress. This is explained by looking at the geometry of the developable surfaces. According to Gauss, such a surface should have everywhere an infinite principal radius of curvature. The same condition holds when one minimizes the elastic energy of a bended plate; up to a small flexural part, this energy is minimum when the plate follows a developable surface. By considering the developable surfaces that are bounded by given closed curves in R3, we show that such a curve does not always bound a piece of developable surface. But one can find a special class of conical surfaces, the d{--}cones, that are still developable in the sense that they can be mapped on a plane by conserving the distances. This d{--}cone gives the outer solution of the elasticity equations, although the vicinity of the tip is described by the full equations, including the flexural term.}},

@article{Konopka2006,
	Abstract = {{The first in vivo measurements of a protein diffusion coefficient versus cytoplasmic biopolymer volume fraction are presented. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching yields the effective diffusion coefficient on a 1-mu m-length scale of green fluorescent protein within the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli grown in rich medium. Resuspension into hyperosmotic buffer lacking K+ and nutrients extracts cytoplasmic water, systematically increasing mean biopolymer volume fraction, <phi >, and thus the severity of possible crowding, binding, and confinement effects. For resuspension in isosmotic buffer (osmotic upshift, or Delta, of 0), the mean diffusion coefficient, < D >, in cytoplasm (6.1 +/- 2.4 mu m(2) s(-1)) is only 0.07 of the in vitro value (87 mu m(2) s(-1)); the relative dispersion among cells, sigma(D)/< D > (standard deviation, sigma(D), relative to the mean), is 0.39. Both < D > and sigma D/< D > remain remarkably constant over the range of Delta values of 0 to 0.28 osmolal. For a Delta value of >= 0.28 osmolal, formation of visible plasmollysis spaces (VPSs) coincides with the onset of a rapid decrease in < D > by a factor of 380 over the range of Delta values of 0.28 to 0.70 osmolal and a substantial increase in sigma(D)/< D >. Individual values of D vary by a factor of 9 X 10(4) but correlate well with f(VPS), the fractional change in cytoplasmic volume on VPS formation. The analysis reveals two levels of dispersion in D among cells: moderate dispersion at low Delta values for cells lacking a VPS, perhaps related to variation in phi or biopolymer organization during the cell cycle, and stronger dispersion at high Delta values related to variation in f(VPS). Crowding effects alone cannot explain the data, nor do these data alone distinguish crowding from possible binding or confinement effects within a cytoplasmic meshwork.}},

Neither the concentration of these particles nor its gradient are assumed to be small. It is shown that the Boltzmann-Enskog kinetic equation has an exact solution describing the state. The hydrodynamic transport equation for the density of labeled particles is derived, with an explicit expression for the involved self-diffusion transport coefficient. Also an approximated expression for the one-particle distribution function is obtained. The system does not exhibit any kind of rheological effects. The theoretical predictions are compared with numerical simulations using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method and a quite good agreement is found.}},

Ellipsoids of moderate aspect ratio ( k{~}<{~}3) are observed to be trapped on the axis of the laser beam, similarly to simple spheres. Conversely, elongated particles ( k{~}>{~}3) cannot be kept immobile, and rather undergo sustained oscillating motions, comprising both lateral and angular excursions around the beam axis; hence the name {``}tumble{''}. The observed tumbling motion, a straightforward manifestation of the non-conservative character of radiation pressure forces, is explained through a 2-dimensional ray optics model of the interaction of light with an ellipsoid.}},

The results are analyzed taking the single-particle case and assuming effective parameters for the bath. The effective microscopic friction coefficient and effective temperature of the tracer are obtained. At high probe velocities, the experimental microviscosity compares well with the viscosity from bulk rheology, whereas a correction due to hydrodynamic interactions (absent in the simulations) is necessary to collapse the simulation data. Surprisingly, agreement is found without any need of hydrodynamic corrections at small probe velocities. The dynamics of the tracer inside the trap shows, both in the simulations and experiments, a fast relaxation due to solvent friction and a slow one caused by the collisions with other particles. The latter is less effective in dissipating the energy introduced by the moving trap and causes increasing fluctuations in the tracer motion, reflected as higher effective temperature.}},

The model describes non-trivial transient displacements of the probe before a steady-state velocity is reached. The external force also induces diffusive motion in the direction perpendicular to its axis. We address the relation between the transverse diffusion coefficient D {$\perp$} and the force-dependent nonlinear friction coefficient {$\zeta$}.

If they could allow the segregation of negative charges on one hemisphere and positive charges on the other one, they would display a giant dipole moment allowing their remote positioning by rotation in an electric field as a function of field polarity. This review deals with the great and imaginative efforts which were devoted to the synthesis of Janus particles in the last fifteen years. A special emphasis is made on scalable techniques and on those which apply to the preparation of Janus particles in the nanometer range.

	Abstract = {{Large crystalline molecular shells, such as some viruses and fullerenes, buckle spontaneously into icosahedra. Meanwhile multicomponent microscopic shells buckle into various polyhedra, as observed in many organelles. Although elastic theory explains one-component icosahedral faceting, the possibility of buckling into other polyhedra has not been explored. We show here that irregular and regular polyhedra, including some Archimedean and Platonic polyhedra, arise spontaneously in elastic shells formed by more than one component. By formulating a generalized elastic model for inhomogeneous shells, we demonstrate that coassembled shells with two elastic components buckle into polyhedra such as dodecahedra, octahedra, tetrahedra, and hosohedra shells via a mechanism that explains many observations, predicts a new family of polyhedral shells, and provides the principles for designing microcontainers with specific shapes and symmetries for numerous applications in materials and life sciences.}},

However, it is not a priori clear that yield strengths of microscale samples measured this way should display the correct finite size scaling. Here we study plastic yield as a depinning transition of a 1{~}+{~}1 dimensional interface, and consider how finite size effects depend on the choice of yield strain, as well as the presence of hardening and the strength of elastic coupling. Our results indicate the existence of a crossover length that depends on the yield strain. It is only above this length scale that standard finite size scaling is expected to hold. These results are also expected to be particularly relevant for simulations of single dislocations, such as those used to study strengthening due to included particles.}},

The experimental results are used to measure the energy of the core for both elastic and plastic deformations. It is shown that the behaviour of a plate when plastic deformations occur, as in practical applications, can be deduced from its behaviour when deformations are perfectly elastic.

Recent developments in the theory and instrumentation of the microrheology of complex fluids are reviewed. Equal emphasis is given to the physical phenomena probed, advances in instrumentation, and specific experimental systems in which this field has already had an impact. The inversion of the compliance data, measurement of sample heterogeneity, high frequency viscoelasticity, effects of shear flow, single molecule experiments, surface viscoelasticity and time evolution studies are considered. The techniques highlighted include particle tracking microrheology, diffusing wave spectroscopy, laser tracking, magnetic tweezers and atomic force microscopy. Specific examples of complex fluid systems are chosen from the fields of polymers, colloids and biological assemblies.}},

Two distinct transport regimes were observed. The pressure-driven mobility of DNA increased with molecular length in channels higher than a few times the molecular radius of gyration, whereas DNA mobility was practically independent of molecular length in thin channels. In addition, both the Taylor dispersion and the self-diffusion of DNA molecules decreased significantly in confined channels in accordance with scaling relationships. These transport properties, which reflect the statistical nature of DNA polymer coils, may be of interest in the development of {``}lab-on-a-chip{''} technologies.}},

	Abstract = {{<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Eukaryotic genomes are organized in sets of chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of a single continuous DNA double-helix and associated proteins that organize locally in the form of a <italic>chromatin</italic> fiber. During cell division (mitosis) chromosomes adopt a compact form that is suitable for transport. During periods of normal cell activity (interphase), they decondense inside the cell nucleus. Being long-chain molecules (in the case of human chromosomes the contour length of the chromatin fiber is on the order of 1 mm), the random thermal motion of interphase chromatin fibers is hindered by entanglements, similar to those restricting the manipulation of a knotted ball of wool. We have studied the consequences of this effect using computer simulations. Most importantly, we find that entanglement effects cause sufficiently long chromosomes to remain segregated during interphase and to form {``}territories.{''} Our model (1) reproduces currently avaliable experimental results for the existence and shape of territories as well as for the internal chromosome structure and dynamics in interphase nuclei and (2) explains why entanglement effects do <italic>not</italic> interfere with the reverse process of chromosome condensation at the end of interphase.</p> }},

Here, we formulate a modified boundary-value problem for these equations and construct post-buckling solutions in good agreement with the observed pattern in twisted strips. We also study the force{--}extension and moment{--}twist behaviour of these strips by varying the mode number n of triangular facets and find critical loads with jumps to higher modes.}},

By employing integral equation theories for the fluid state and comparing with Monte Carlo simulation results, we establish the limits of applicability of various common closures and examine the dependence of the correlation functions of the liquid on the density and temperature. We employ a simple, mean-field theory for the high-density domain of the liquid and demonstrate that at infinite density the mean-field theory is exact and that the system reduces to an {`}infinite-density ideal gas{'}, where all correlations vanish and where the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure becomes exact. By employing an Einstein model for the solid phases, we subsequently calculate quantitatively the phase diagram of the model and find that the system possesses two solid phases, face-centred cubic and body-centred cubic, and also displays re-entrant melting into a liquid at high densities. Moreover, the system remains fluid at all densities when the temperature exceeds 1% of the strength of the interactions.}},

The work presented here investigates instabilities that can occur when thin bodies are subject to large twists and extends work by A. E. Green published in 1937. Because large twists are considered, a fully nonlinear plate theory is used. This theory predicts compressive lateral membrane stresses not predicted by Green{'}s weakly nonlinear theory. These stresses can significantly alter the twist angle at which buckling occurs. Two conditions for the opposing twisted end supports are considered. In one case the supports are held a fixed distance apart and in the other case the force applied to the supports is held fixed during twist. The buckling modes and critical twist angles vary significantly depending on the support condition used.}},

	Abstract = {{A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that the diffusive motion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarizing their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a sublinear, power-law increase of the mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations in time, non-Gaussian distributions of spatial displacements, heterogeneous diffusion and a fraction of immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarize some widely used theoretical models: Gaussian models like fractional Brownian motion and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the continuous-time random walk model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Particular emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of two-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even if the MSDs are identical. Then, we review the theory underlying commonly applied experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport like single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where a variety of model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations are discussed which play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings. The review is completed by a synthesis of the theoretical and experimental progress identifying open questions for future investigation.}},

	Abstract = {{Smooth wrinkles and sharply crumpled regions are familiar motifs in biological or synthetic sheets, such as rapidly growing plant leaves and crushed foils. Previous studies have addressed both morphological types, but the generic route whereby a featureless sheet develops a complex shape remains elusive. Here we show that this route proceeds through an unusual sequence of distinct symmetry-breaking instabilities. The object of our study is an ultrathin circular sheet stretched over a liquid drop. As the curvature is gradually increased, the surface tension stretching the sheet over the drop causes compression along circles of latitude. The compression is relieved first by a transition into a wrinkle pattern, and then into a crumpled state via a continuous transition. Our data provide conclusive evidence that wrinkle patterns in highly bendable sheets are not described by classical buckling methods, but rather by a theory which assumes that wrinkles completely relax the compressive stress. With this understanding we recognize the observed sequence of transitions as distinct symmetry breakings of the shape and the stress field. The axial symmetry of the shape is broken upon wrinkling but the underlying stress field preserves this symmetry. Thus, the wrinkle-to-crumple transition marks symmetry-breaking of the stress in highly bendable sheets. By contrast, other instabilities of sheets, such as blistering and cracking, break the homogeneity of shape and stress simultaneously. The onset of crumpling occurs when the wrinkle pattern grows to half the sheet{'}s radius, suggesting a geometric, material-independent origin for this transition.}},

@article{Grason2013,
	Abstract = {{Imposing curvature on crystalline sheets, such as 2D packings of colloids or proteins, or covalently bonded graphene leads to distinct types of structural instabilities. The first type involves the proliferation of localized defects that disrupt the crystalline order without affecting the imposed shape, whereas the second type consists of elastic modes, such as wrinkles and crumples, which deform the shape and also are common in amorphous polymer sheets. Here, we propose a profound link between these types of patterns, encapsulated in a universal, compression-free stress field, which is determined solely by the macroscale confining conditions. This {``}stress universality{''} principle and a few of its immediate consequences are borne out by studying a circular crystalline patch bound to a deformable spherical substrate, in which the two distinct patterns become, respectively, radial chains of dislocations (called {``}scars{''}) and radial wrinkles. The simplicity of this set-up allows us to characterize the morphologies and evaluate the energies of both patterns, from which we construct a phase diagram that predicts a wrinkle{--}scar transition in confined crystalline sheets at a critical value of the substrate stiffness. The construction of a unified theoretical framework that bridges inelastic crystalline defects and elastic deformations opens unique research directions. Beyond the potential use of this concept for finding energy-optimizing packings in curved topographies, the possibility of transforming defects into shape deformations that retain the crystalline structure may be valuable for a broad range of material applications, such as manipulations of graphene{'}s electronic structure.}},

Bending moments, shearing forces and membrane stresses are calculated, and graphs are drawn showing how they vary over the plate. The edge shears discussed in (10) are plotted against distance along the free edges, and the work of Fung and Wittrick (11), is used to estimate the maximum stresses in the boundary layer.}},

Whereas coalescence has been thoroughly studied when drops coalesce in vacuum or air, many important situations involve coalescence in a dense surrounding fluid, such as oil coalescence in brine. Here we study the merging of gas bubbles and liquid drops in an external fluid. Our data indicate that the flows occur over much larger length scales in the outer fluid than inside the drops themselves. Thus, we find that the asymptotic early regime is always dominated by the viscosity of the drops, independent of the external fluid. A phase diagram showing the crossovers into the different possible late-time dynamics identifies a dimensionless number that signifies when the external viscosity can be important.}},

@article{Champneys1996,
	Abstract = {{The Kirchhoff-Love equations governing the spatial equilibria of long thin elastic rods subject to end tension and moment are reviewed and used to examine the existence of localized buckling solutions. The effects of shear and axial extension are not considered, but the model does additionally allow for nonlinear constitutive laws. Under the assumption of infinite length, the dynamical phase space analogy allows one to use techniques from dynamical systems theory to characterize many possible equilibrium paths. Localizing solutions correspond to homoclinic orbits of the dynamical system. Under non-dimensionalization the twisted rod equations are shown to depend on a single load parameter, and the bifurcation behaviour of localizing solutions of this problem is investigated using analytical and numerical techniques. First, in the case of a rod with equal principal bending stiffnesses, where the equilibrium equations are completely integrable, a known one-parameter family of localizing solutions is computed for a variety of subcritical loads. Load-deflection diagrams are computed for this family and certain materially nonlinear constitutive laws are shown to make little difference to the qualitative picture. The breaking of the geometrical circular symmetry destroys complete integrability and, in particular, breaks the non-transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of the trivial steady state. The resulting transverse intersection, which is already known to lead to spatial chaos, is explicitly demonstrated to imply a multitude of localized buckling modes. A sample of primary and multi-modal solutions are computed numerically, aided by the reversibility of the differential equations. Finally, parallels are drawn with the conceptually simpler problem of a strut resting on a (nonlinear) elastic foundation, for which much more information is known about the global behaviour of localized buckling modes.}},

	Abstract = {{Coalescence is an essential phenomenon that governs the equilibrium behaviour in a variety of systems from intercellular transport to planetary formation. In this report, we study coalescence pathways of circularly shaped two-dimensional colloidal membranes, which are one rod-length-thick liquid-like monolayers of aligned rods. The chirality of the constituent rods leads to three atypical coalescence pathways that are not found in other simple or complex fluids. In particular, we characterize two pathways that do not proceed to completion but instead produce partially joined membranes connected by line defects{---}{$\pi$}-wall defects or alternating arrays of twisted bridges and pores. We elucidate the structure and energetics of these defects and ascribe their stability to a geometrical frustration inherently present in chiral colloidal membranes. Furthermore, we induce the coalescence process with optical forces, leading to a robust on-demand method for imprinting networks of channels and pores into colloidal membranes.}},

	Abstract = {{Mechanical forces generated by cells modulate global shape changes required for essential life processes, such as polarization, division and spreading. Although the contribution of the cytoskeleton to cellular force generation is widely recognized, the role of the membrane is considered to be restricted to passively transmitting forces. Therefore, the mechanisms by which the membrane can directly contribute to cell tension are overlooked and poorly understood. To address this, we directly measure the stresses generated during liposome adhesion. We find that liposome spreading generates large traction stresses on compliant substrates. These stresses can be understood as the equilibration of internal, hydrostatic pressures generated by the enhanced membrane tension built up during adhesion. These results underscore the role of membranes in the generation of mechanical stresses on cellular length scales and that the modulation of hydrostatic pressure due to membrane tension and adhesion can be channelled to perform mechanical work on the environment.}},

Analytical solution of this, presumably simplest, statistical mechanical model reveals the dependence of the electrical capacitance on voltage, pore radius, and temperature. The voltage dependence of capacitance has the character of a smeared resonance, whose position and height is affected by a tiny change of the pore radius. Consequently, even the slightest dispersion of pore radii in the whole electrode, unavoidable in any real system, softens the voltage dependence.}},

	Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior and properties of multilayer graphene sheets and nanoribbons have been a subject of intensive research in recent years, due to their potential in electronic, structural and thermal applications. Calculations of effective properties range from molecular dynamic simulations to use of structural mechanical continuum models. Here, structural and elastic parameters are obtained via full atomistic simulations, and a two-dimensional mesoscopic model for a sheet of graphene is developed utilizing coarse-grain bead-spring elements with rotational-spring potentials. The assertion of energy conservation between atomistic and mesoscale models through elastic strain energy is enforced to arrive at model parameters, incorporating normal and shear strains, out-of-plane bending and intramolecular interactions. We then apply our mesoscopic model to investigate the structure and conformational behavior of twisted ultralong multilayer graphene ribbons with lengths of hundreds of nanometers, representing several millions of individual atoms, beyond the accessible regime of full atomistic molecular dynamics. We find a distinct transition from a twisted (saddle-like) configuration to a helical (coil-like) configuration as a function of imposed rotation and number of graphene layers. Further, for single layer graphene ribbons, multiple, stable configurations occur at discrete rotations due to the surface adhesion. The model developed and applied here can be more generally used to investigate properties of other two-dimensional membrane and ribbon-like systems for mesoscale hierarchical material design.}},

The avalanches are power-law distributed in size, and have a typical average shape: these are the two most important signatures of avalanching systems. Here we show how the average avalanche shape evolves with the universality class of the avalanche dynamics by employing a combination of scaling theory, extensive numerical simulations and data from crack propagation experiments. It follows a simple scaling form parameterized by two numbers, the scaling exponent relating the average avalanche size to its duration and a parameter characterizing the temporal asymmetry of the avalanches. The latter reflects a broken time-reversal symmetry in the avalanche dynamics, emerging from the local nature of the interaction kernel mediating the avalanche dynamics.}},

	Abstract = {{Self-actuating materials capable of transforming between three-dimensional shapes have applications in areas as diverse as biomedicine, robotics, and tunable micro-optics. We introduce a method of photopatterning polymer films that yields temperature-responsive gel sheets that can transform between a flat state and a prescribed three-dimensional shape. Our approach is based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) copolymers containing pendent benzophenone units that allow cross-linking to be tuned by irradiation dose. We describe a simple method of halftone gel lithography using only two photomasks, wherein highly cross-linked dots embedded in a lightly cross-linked matrix provide access to nearly continuous, and fully two-dimensional, patterns of swelling. This method is used to fabricate surfaces with constant Gaussian curvature (spherical caps, saddles, and cones) or zero mean curvature (Enneper{'}s surfaces), as well as more complex and nearly closed shapes.}},

We show that the distribution of relative angles of motion between successive time intervals of random walks in two or more dimensions provides information about stochastic processes beyond the MSD. We illustrate the behavior of this measure for common models and apply it to experimental particle tracking data. For a colloidal system, the distribution of relative angles reports sensitively on caging as the density varies. For transport mediated by molecular motors on filament networks in vitro and in vivo, we discover self-similar properties that cannot be described by existing models and discuss possible scenarios that can lead to the elucidated statistical features.}},

	Abstract = {{During the cell cycle, the organization of the cytoskeletal network undergoes dramatic changes. In order to reveal possible changes of the viscoelastic properties in the intracellular space during the cell cycle we investigated the diffusion of endogenous lipid granules within the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces Pombe using optical tweezers. The cell cycle was divided into interphase and mitotic cell division, and the mitotic cell division was further subdivided in its stages. During all stages of the cell cycle, the granules predominantly underwent subdiffusive motion, characterized by an exponent {$\alpha$} that is also linked to the viscoelastic moduli of the cytoplasm. The exponent {$\alpha$} was significantly smaller during interphase than during any stage of the mitotic cell division, signifying that the cytoplasm was more elastic during interphase than during division. We found no significant differences in the subdiffusive exponents from granules measured in different stages of cell division. Also, our results for the exponent displayed no significant dependence on the position of the granule within the cell. The observation that the cytoplasm is more elastic during interphase than during mitotic cell division is consistent with the fact that elastic cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules are less abundantly present during cell division than during interphase.}},

	Abstract = {{It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabulated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.}},

We argue that this distribution behaves as $P(x)\sim x^{$\theta$}$ , where the exponent {$\theta$} is larger than zero if the elastic interaction between rearranging regions is non-monotonic, and increases with the interaction range. For a class of finite-dimensional models we show that stability implies a lower bound on {$\theta$} , which is found to lie near saturation. For quadrupolar interactions these models yield ${$\theta$}\approx 0.6$ for d = 2 and ${$\theta$}\approx 0.4$ in d = 3 where d is the spatial dimension, accurately capturing previously unresolved observations in atomistic models, both in quasi-static flow and after a fast quench. In addition, we compute the Herschel-Buckley exponent in these models and show that it depends on a subtle choice of dynamical rules, whereas the exponent {$\theta$} does not.}},

The nucleation and growth of a protein coat is a kinetic process that competes with the energy-consuming turnover of coat components between the membrane and the cytosol. We propose a generic kinetic description of coat assembly and the formation of coated vesicles and discuss its implication to the dynamics of COP vesicles that traffic within the Golgi and with the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that stationary coats of fixed area emerge from the competition between coat growth and the recycling of coat components, in a fashion resembling the treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments. We further show that the turnover of coat components allows for a highly sensitive switching mechanism between a quiescent and a vesicle producing membrane, upon a slowing down of the exchange kinetics. We claim that the existence of this switching behavior, also triggered by factors, such as the presence of cargo and variation of the membrane mechanical tension, allows for efficient regulation of vesicle secretion. We propose a model, supported by different experimental observations, in which vesiculation of secretory membranes is impaired by the energy-consuming desorption of coat proteins, until the presence of cargo or other factors triggers a dynamical switch into a vesicle producing state.}},

However, we show that for ribbons with a longitudinal natural radius of curvature a0, geometrical constraints lead to strain localization which controls the dynamics. This localized region of deformation selects a specific curling deformation front which travels down the ribbon when initially flattened and released. Performing experiments on different ribbons, in air and in water, we show that initially, on length scales on the order of a0, the curling front moves as a power law of time with an exponent ranging from 0.5 to 2 for increasing values of the ribbons{'} width. At longer time scales, the material wraps itself at a constant speed Vr into a roll of radius R [not equal] a0. The relationship between Vr and R is calculated by a balance between kinetic, elastic and gravitational energy and both internal and external powers dissipated. When gravity and drag are negligible, we observe that a0/R reaches a limiting value of 0.48 that we predict by solving the Elastica on the curled ribbon considering the centrifugal forces due to rotation. The solution we propose represents a solitary traveling curvature wave which is reminiscent to propagating instabilities in mechanics.}},

	Abstract = {{The lateral mobility of proteins within cell membranes is usually thought to be dependent on their size and modulated by local heterogeneities of the membrane. Experiments using single-particle tracking on reconstituted membranes demonstrate that protein diffusion is significantly influenced by the interplay of membrane curvature, membrane tension, and protein shape. We find that the curvature-coupled voltage-gated potassium channel (KvAP) undergoes a significant increase in protein mobility under tension, whereas the mobility of the curvature-neutral water channel aquaporin 0 (AQP0) is insensitive to it. Such observations are well explained in terms of an effective friction coefficient of the protein induced by the local membrane deformation.}},

This sluggishness is often ascribed to the free energy landscape containing multiple minima (basins) separated by high barriers. Here we show, using theory and numerical simulation, that the landscape is much rougher than is classically assumed. Deep in the glass, it undergoes a {`}roughness transition{'} to fractal basins, which brings about isostaticity and marginal stability on approaching jamming. Critical exponents for the basin width, the weak force distribution and the spatial spread of quasi-contacts near jamming can be analytically determined. Their value is found to be compatible with numerical observations. This advance incorporates the jamming transition of granular materials into the framework of glass theory. Because temperature and pressure control what features of the landscape are experienced, glass mechanics and transport are expected to reflect the features of the topology we discuss here.}},

However, the transition from sinusoidal wrinkles to more complex strain localized features, such as delaminations or folds, is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the onset of wrinkling and strain localizations in a model system of a glassy polymer film attached to a surface of an elastomeric substrate. We show that careful measurement of feature amplitude as a function of applied strain allows not only the determination of wrinkle, fold, or delamination onset but also allows clear distinction between each type of feature. We observe that amplitude increases discontinuously as delamination occurs; whereas, the amplitude for a fold deviates gradually compared to the amplitude for a nearby wrinkle as a function of applied strain. The folds observed in these experiments have an outward morphology from the surface, in contrast to folds that form into the plane for a film floating on a liquid substrate. A deformation mode map is presented, where the measured critical strain for localization is compared for films with thickness ranging from 5 nm to 180 nm.}},

	Abstract = {{We study crystal nucleation under the influence of sedimentation in a model of colloidal hard spheres via Brownian dynamics simulations. We introduce two external fields acting on the colloidal fluid: a uniform gravitational field (body force), and a surface field imposed by pinning a layer of equilibrium particles (rough wall). We show that crystal nucleation is suppressed in proximity of the wall due to the slowing down of the dynamics, and that the spatial range of this effect is governed by the static length scale of bond orientational order. For distances from the wall larger than this length scale, the nucleation rate is greatly enhanced by the process of sedimentation, since it leads to a higher volume fraction, or a higher degree of supercooling, near the bottom. The nucleation stage is similar to the homogeneous case, with nuclei being on average spherical and having crystalline planes randomly oriented in space. The growth stage is instead greatly affected by the symmetry breaking introduced by the gravitation field, with a slowing down of the attachment rate due to density gradients, which in turn cause nuclei to grow faster laterally. Our findings suggest that the increase of crystal nucleation in higher density regions might be the cause of the large discrepancy in the crystal nucleation rate of hard spheres between experiments and simulations, on noting that the gravitational effects in previous experiments are not negligible.}},

The wrinkling pattern is characterized by the number and length of the wrinkles. The dependence of the number of wrinkles on the elastic properties of the film and on the capillary force exerted by the drop confirms recent theoretical predictions on the selection of a pattern with a well-defined length scale in the wrinkling instability. We combined scaling relations that were developed for the length of the wrinkles with those for the number of wrinkles to construct a metrology for measuring the elasticity and thickness of ultrathin films that relies on no more than a dish of fluid and a low-magnification microscope. We validated this method on polymer films modified by plasticizer. The relaxation of the wrinkles affords a simple method to study the viscoelastic response of ultrathin films.}},

@article{Weiss2014,
	Abstract = {{The larger structures are, the lower their mechanical strength. Already discussed by Leonardo da Vinci and Edm{\'{e}} Mariotte several centuries ago, size effects on strength remain of crucial importance in modern engineering for the elaboration of safety regulations in structural design or the extrapolation of laboratory results to geophysical field scales. Under tensile loading, statistical size effects are traditionally modeled with a weakest-link approach. One of its prominent results is a prediction of vanishing strength at large scales that can be quantified in the framework of extreme value statistics. Despite a frequent use outside its range of validity, this approach remains the dominant tool in the field of statistical size effects. Here we focus on compressive failure, which concerns a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical situations. We show on historical and recent experimental data that weakest-link predictions are not obeyed. In particular, the mechanical strength saturates at a nonzero value toward large scales. Accounting explicitly for the elastic interactions between defects during the damage process, we build a formal analogy of compressive failure with the depinning transition of an elastic manifold. This critical transition interpretation naturally entails finite-size scaling laws for the mean strength and its associated variability. Theoretical predictions are in remarkable agreement with measurements reported for various materials such as rocks, ice, coal, or concrete. This formalism, which can also be extended to the flowing instability of granular media under multiaxial compression, has important practical consequences for future design rules.}},

@article{Baoukina2008,
	Abstract = {{Lipid monolayers at an air{--}water interface can be compressed laterally and reach high surface density. Beyond a certain threshold, they become unstable and collapse. Lipid monolayer collapse plays an important role in the regulation of surface tension at the air{--}liquid interface in the lungs. Although the structures of lipid aggregates formed upon collapse can be characterized experimentally, the mechanism leading to these structures is not fully understood. We investigate the molecular mechanism of monolayer collapse using molecular dynamics simulations. Upon lateral compression, the collapse begins with buckling of the monolayer, followed by folding of the buckle into a bilayer in the water phase. Folding leads to an increase in the monolayer surface tension, which reaches the equilibrium spreading value. Immediately after their formation, the bilayer folds have a flat semielliptical shape, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The folds undergo further transformation and form either flat circular bilayers or vesicles. The transformation pathway depends on macroscopic parameters of the system: the bending modulus, the line tension at the monolayer{--}bilayer connection, and the line tension at the bilayer perimeter. These parameters are determined by the system composition and temperature. Coexistence of the monolayer with lipid aggregates is favorable at lower tensions of the monolayer{--}bilayer connection. Transformation into a vesicle reduces the energy of the fold perimeter and is facilitated for softer bilayers, e.g., those with a higher content of unsaturated lipids, or at higher temperatures.}},

	Abstract = {{Supramolecular chirality defines chirality at the supramolecular level, and is generated from the spatial arrangement of component molecules assembling through non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, [small pi]-[small pi] stacking, hydrophobic interactions and so on. During the formation of low molecular weight gels (LMWGs), one kind of fascinating soft material, one frequently encounters the phenomenon of chirality as well as chiral nanostructures, either from chiral gelators or even achiral gelators. A view of gelation-induced supramolecular chirality will be very helpful to understand the self-assembly process of the gelator molecules as well as the chiral structures, the regulation of the chirality in the gels and the development of the "smart" chiral materials such as chiroptical devices, catalysts and chiral sensors. It necessitates fundamental understanding of chirality transfer and amplification in these supramolecular systems. In this review, recent progress in gelation-induced supramolecular chirality is discussed.}},

	Abstract = {{A generic statistical mechanical model is presented for the self-assembly of chiral rod-like units, such as {$\beta$}-sheet-forming peptides, into helical tapes, which with increasing concentration associate into twisted ribbons (double tapes), fibrils (twisted stacks of ribbons), and fibers (entwined fibrils). The finite fibril width and helicity is shown to stem from a competition between the free energy gain from attraction between ribbons and the penalty because of elastic distortion of the intrinsically twisted ribbons on incorporation into a growing fibril. Fibers are stabilized similarly. The behavior of two rationally designed 11-aa residue peptides, P11-I and P11-II, is illustrative of the proposed scheme. P11-I and P11-II are designed to adopt the {$\beta$}-strand conformation and to self-assemble in one dimension to form antiparallel {$\beta$}-sheet tapes, ribbons, fibrils, and fibers in well-defined solution conditions. The energetic parameters governing self-assembly have been estimated from the experimental data using the model. The 8-nm-wide fibrils consist of eight tapes, are extremely robust (scission energy {$\approx$}200 kBT), and sufficiently rigid (persistence length l*fibril {$\approx$} 20{--}70 {$\mu$}m) to form nematic solutions at peptide concentration c {$\approx$} 0.9 mM (volume fraction {$\approx$}0.0009 vol/vol), which convert to self-supporting nematic gels at c > 4 mM. More generally, these observations provide a new insight into the generic self-assembling properties of {$\beta$}-sheet-forming peptides and shed new light on the factors governing the structures and stability of pathological amyloid fibrils in vivo. The model also provides a prescription of routes to novel macromolecules based on a variety of self-assembling chiral units, and protocols for extraction of the associated energy changes.}},

Starting from the equations of membrane theory modified to account for surface energies, we show that the presence of a liquid drop causes an azimuthal compression over a finite region. This explains the origin of the wrinkling of such membranes observed recently (Huang et al., Science, 2007, 317, 650) and suggests a single parameter that determines the extent of the wrinkled region. While experimental data supports the importance of this single parameter, our theory under-predicts the extent of the wrinkled region observed experimentally. We suggest that this discrepancy is likely to be due to the wrinkling observed here being far from the threshold.}},

The difference in surface tension induces compressive stresses, which result in regular orthoradial wrinkles beyond a critical difference in surface tension. The wrinkles first appear in the vicinity of the inner edge of the annulus and progressively grow as the concentration of surfactant is increased. Conversely, the wavenumber remains constant and relies on a simple balance between gravity and the bending stiffness of the membrane within the range of our experimental parameters. Our experiments fall outside the regimes explored in the literature for similar situations, and we propose an approximate analytical description that completes the existing theoretical grounds.}},

Both quantum and thermal fluctuations are taken into account by a Langevin equation for the field. The method allows the Casimir force to be obtained directly, derived from the stress tensor instead of the free energy. It only requires the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian operator in the given geometry. The formalism provides also an expression for the fluctuations of the force. As an application we compute the Casimir force on the plates of a finite piston of arbitrary cross-section. Fluctuations of the force are also directly obtained, and it is shown that, in the piston case, the variance of the force is twice the force squared.}},

By virtue of their interactions, these mechanically stable lattice defects also lead to emergent crystallographic structures such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries. Each of these structures comes from an arrangement of reversible folds, highlighting a connection between mechanical metamaterials and programmable matter.

	Abstract = {{The shear rheology of soft particle systems becomes complex at large density because crowding effects may induce a glass transition for Brownian particles or a jamming transition for non-Brownian systems. Here we successfully explore the hypothesis that the shear stress contributions from glass and jamming physics are {'}additive{'}. We show that the experimental flow curves measured in a large variety of soft materials (colloidal hard spheres, microgel suspensions, emulsions, aqueous foams) as well as numerical flow curves obtained for soft repulsive particles in both thermal and athermal limits are well described by a simple model assuming that glass and jamming rheologies contribute linearly to the shear stress, provided that the relevant scales for time and stress are correctly identified in both sectors. Our analysis confirms that the dynamics of colloidal hard spheres is uniquely controlled by glass physics while aqueous foams are only sensitive to jamming effects. We show that for micron-sized emulsions both contributions are needed to successfully account for the flow curves, which reveal distinct signatures of both phenomena. Finally, for two systems of soft microgel particles we show that the flow curves are representative of the glass transition of colloidal systems, and deduce that microgel particles are not well suited to studying the jamming transition experimentally.}},

General arguments indicate that the shear-rate dependence of the stress results from an interplay between the time scales of the macroscopic drive and the (cascades of) local particle rearrangements. Such rearrangements are known to induce a redistribution of the elastic stress in the system. Although mechanical noise, i.e. , the local stress fluctuations arising from this redistribution, is widely believed to activate new particle rearrangements, we provide evidence that it casts severe doubt on the analogy with thermal fluctuations: mechanical and thermal fluctuations lead to asymptotically different statistics for barrier crossing. These ideas are illustrated and supported by a simple elasto-plastic model whose ingredients are directly connected with the physical processes relevant for the flow.}},

Although this non-Newtonian behavior is believed to arise from the arrangement of suspended particles and their mutual interactions, microscopic particle dynamics are difficult to measure. By combining fast confocal microscopy with simultaneous force measurements, we systematically investigate a suspension{'}s structure as it transitions through regimes of different flow signatures. Our measurements of the microscopic single-particle dynamics show that shear thinning results from the decreased relative contribution of entropic forces and that shear thickening arises from particle clustering induced by hydrodynamic lubrication forces. This combination of techniques illustrates an approach that complements current methods for determining the microscopic origins of non-Newtonian flow behavior in complex fluids.}},

Here, we recreate this phenomenon using actuated nonliving components. We report here that millimetre-sized tapered rods, rendered motile by contact with an underlying vibrated surface and interacting through a medium of spherical beads, undergo a phase transition to a state of spontaneous alignment of velocities and orientations above a threshold bead area fraction. Guided by a detailed simulation model, we construct an analytical theory of this flocking transition, with two ingredients: a moving rod drags beads; neighbouring rods reorient in the resulting flow like a weathercock in the wind. Theory and experiment agree on the structure of our phase diagram in the plane of rod and bead concentrations and power-law spatial correlations near the phase boundary. Our discovery suggests possible new mechanisms for the collective transport of particulate or cellular matter.}},

We show that, whereas the Johnson{--}Kendall{--}Roberts theory holds for particles larger than a critical, elastocapillary lengthscale, it fails for smaller particles. Instead, adhesion of small particles mimics the adsorption of particles at a fluid interface, with a size-independent contact angle between the undeformed surface and the particle given by a generalized version of the Young's law. A simple theory quantitatively captures this behaviour and explains how solid surface tension dominates elasticity for small-scale indentation of soft materials.}},

	Abstract = {{In this paper we present a theoretical study on how surface tension affects fracture of soft solids. In classical fracture theory, the resistance to fracture is partly attributed to the energy required to create new surfaces. Thus, the energy released to the crack tip must overcome the surface energy in order to propagate a crack. In soft materials, however, surface tension can cause significant deformation and can reduce the energy release rate for crack propagation by resisting the stretch of crack surfaces. We quantify this effect by studying the inflation of a penny-shaped crack in an infinite elastic body with applied pressure. To avoid numerical difficulty caused by singular fields near the crack tip, we derived an expression for the energy release rate which depends on the applied pressure, the surface tension, the inflated crack volume and the deformed crack area. This expression is evaluated using a newly developed finite element method with surface tension elements. Our calculation shows that, when the elasto-capillary number [small omega] [identical with] [sigma]/Ea is sufficiently large, where [sigma] is the isotropic surface tension, E is the small strain Young{'}s modulus and a is the initial crack radius, both the energy release rate and the crack opening displacement of an incompressible neo-Hookean solid are significantly reduced by surface tension. For a sufficiently high elasto-capillary number, the energy release rate can be negative for applied pressure less than a critical amount, suggesting that surface tension can cause crack healing in soft elastic materials.}},

	Abstract = {{Passive particle tracking of diffusive paths in soft matter, coupled with analysis of the path data, is firmly established as a fundamental methodology for characterization of both diffusive transport properties (the focus here) and linear viscoelasticity. For either focus, particle time series are typically analyzed by ensemble averaging over paths, a perfectly natural protocol for homogeneous materials or for applications where mean properties are sufficient. Many biological materials, however, are heterogeneous over length scales above the probe diameter, and the implications of heterogeneity for biologically relevant transport properties (e.g. diffusive passage times through a complex fluid layer) motivate this paper. Our goals are three-fold: first, to detect heterogeneity as reflected by the ensemble path data; second, to further decompose the ensemble of particle paths into statistically distinct clusters; and third, to fit the path data in each cluster to a model for the underlying stochastic process. After reviewing current best practices for detection and assessment of heterogeneity in diffusive processes, we introduce our strategy toward the first two goals with methods from the statistics and machine learning literature that have not found application thus far to passive particle tracking data. We apply an analysis based solely on the path data that detects heterogeneity and yields a decomposition of particle paths into statistically distinct clusters. After these two goals are achieved, one can then pursue model-fitting. We illustrate these heterogeneity metrics on diverse datasets: for numerically generated and experimental particle paths, with tunable and unknown heterogeneity, on numerical models for simple diffusion and anomalous sub-diffusion, and experimentally on sucrose, hyaluronic acid, agarose, and human lung culture mucus solutions.}},

The field dependence of the wall velocity displays a creep behaviour, consistently with a critical slowing-down when the field tends to zero.

Yet, no clear structural signature has been found for this collective self-organization. Here, we demonstrate an archetypal Loschmidt-echo experiment involving thousands of droplets that interact in a reversible fashion via a viscous fluid. First, we show that periodically driven microfluidic emulsions self-organize and geometrically protect their macroscopic reversibility. Self-organization is not merely dynamical: it has a clear structural signature. Second, we show that, above a maximal shaking amplitude, structural order and reversibility are lost simultaneously through a first-order non-equilibrium phase transition. We account for this discontinuous transition in terms of a memory-loss process. Finally, we suggest potential applications of microfluidic echo as a robust tool to tailor colloidal self-assembly at large scales.}},

Of particular interest is the ability to control the shape of the droplet contact area on the surface, which is typically circular on a smooth homogeneous surface. Here, we show the ability to tailor various droplet contact area shapes ranging from squares, rectangles, hexagons, octagons, to dodecagons via the design of the structure or chemical heterogeneity on the surface. We simultaneously obtain the necessary physical insights to develop a universal model for the three-dimensional droplet shape by characterizing the droplet side and top profiles. Furthermore, arrays of droplets with controlled shapes and high spatial resolution can be achieved using this approach. This liquid-based patterning strategy promises low-cost fabrication of integrated circuits, conductive patterns and bio-microarrays for high-density information storage and miniaturized biochips and biosensors, among others.}},

However, accurate analysis of diffusion behaviours and including other parameters, such as the conformation and size of molecules, remain as limitations to the method. Here, we report a method that addresses the limitations of existing single-molecular localization methods. The method is based on temporal tracking of the cumulative area occupied by molecules. These temporal fluctuations are tied to molecular size, rates of diffusion and conformational changes. By analysing fluorescent nanospheres and double-stranded DNA molecules of different lengths and topological forms, we demonstrate that our cumulative-area method surpasses the conventional single-molecule localization method in terms of the accuracy of determined diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, the cumulative-area method provides conformational relaxation times of structurally flexible chains along with diffusion coefficients, which together are relevant to work in a wide spectrum of scientific fields.}},

	Abstract = {{Cracks play a major role in most rocks submitted to crustal conditions. Mechanically, cracks make the rock much more compliant. They also make it much easier for fluid to flow through any rock body. Relying on Fracture Mechanics and Statistical Physics, we introduce a few key concepts, which allow to understand and quantify how cracks do modify both the elastic and transport properties of rocks. The main different schemes, which can be used to derive the elastic effective moduli of a rock, are presented. It is shown from experimental results that an excellent approximation is the so-called non-interactive scheme. The main consequences of the existence of cracks on the elastic waves is the development of elastic anisotropy (due to the anisotropic distribution of crack orientations) and the dispersion effect (due to microscopic local fluid flow). At a larger scale, macroscopic fluid flow takes place through the crack network above the percolation threshold. Two macroscopic fluid flow regimes can be distinguished: the percolative regime close to the percolation threshold and the connected regime well above it. Experimental data on very different rock types show both of these behaviors. }},

@article{Heap2009,
	Abstract = {{Volcanic edifices, such as Mt. Etna (Italy), are commonly subject to repeated cycles of stress over time due to the combination of magma emplacement from deep reservoirs to shallow depths and superimposed tectonic stresses. Such repeated stress cycles lead to anisotropic deformation and an increase in the level of crack damage within the rocks of the edifice and hence changes to their elastic moduli, which are a key parameter for reliable modelling of deformation sources. We therefore report results of changes in elastic moduli measured during increasing amplitude cyclic stressing experiments on dry and water-saturated samples of Etna basalt. In all experiments, the Young{'}s modulus decreased by approximately 30% over the total sequence of loading cycles, and the Poisson{'}s ratio increased by a factor of approximately 3{~}{$\pm$}{~}0.5. Microseismicity, in terms of acoustic emission (AE) output, was also recorded throughout each experiment. Our results demonstrate that AE output only re-commences during any loading cycle when the level of stress where AE ceased during the unloading portion of the previous cycle is exceeded; a manifestation of the Kaiser stress-memory effect. In cycles where no AE output was generated, we also observed no change in elastic moduli. This result holds for both mechanical and thermal stressing. Our results are interpreted in relation to measurements of volcano-tectonic seismicity and deformation at Mt. Etna volcano. }},

	Abstract = {{The coupled development of compaction and strain localization may significantly impact the stress field, strain partitioning and fluid transport. To investigate the phenomenon of compaction localization, mechanical deformation and microstructural observations were conducted on the Darley Dale, Rothbach, Berea, Bentheim and Diemelstadt sandstones with porosities ranging from 13 to 24%. The constitutive behavior, failure mode, acoustic emission (AE) activity and spatial distribution of damage were investigated. While our observations reveal a broad spectrum of geometric complexity associated with failure modes, two end-members can be distinguished: shear bands at relatively high angles and arrays of discrete compaction bands subperpendicular to the maximum compression direction, respectively. A hybrid localization mode involving high-angle shear bands and diffuse compaction bands was observed in sandstones with intermediate porosities. The discrete compaction bands in our laboratory samples are qualitatively similar to localization structures observed in the field. Whereas the development of high-angle shear bands is characterized by the continuous accumulation of AE, discrete bands are associated with episodic surges in AE that are characterized by an overall strain hardening trend punctuated by episodic stress drops. }},

	Abstract = {{Brittle deformation in rocks is accompanied by the formation of microcracks which emit elastic energy partly as acoustic emissions. Acoustic emission parameters such as amplitude may be related to geometric parameters such as crack size. We have analyzed catalogues of acoustic emission events recorded during compression tests in rock in terms of the information they give about the accumulated state of damage in a material. We combine this measured damage state with a model for the softening behaviour of cracked solids, and show that reasonable predictions of the mechanical behaviour are possible. Several strategies have to be used to allow for incomplete recording of the acoustic emissions. An independent calibration of the scaling relation between the acoustic emission parameters and the microcrack geometry remains outstanding, although the results here suggest constraints on the scaling relation. We show, however, that this quantitative approach is markedly superior to the more traditional methods of acoustic emission analysis in correlating the acoustic activity with the weakening of the material. }},

Despite their ubiquity, no model has been developed that captures or predicts the complexities of granular flow, posing an obstacle in industrial and geophysical applications. Here we propose a 3D constitutive model for well-developed, dense granular flows aimed at filling this need. The key ingredient of the theory is a grain-size-dependent nonlocal rheology{---}inspired by efforts for emulsions{---}in which flow at a point is affected by the local stress as well as the flow in neighboring material. The microscopic physical basis for this approach borrows from recent principles in soft glassy rheology. The size-dependence is captured using a single material parameter, and the resulting model is able to quantitatively describe dense granular flows in an array of different geometries. Of particular importance, it passes the stringent test of capturing all aspects of the highly nontrivial flows observed in split-bottom cells{---}a geometry that has resisted modeling efforts for nearly a decade. A key benefit of the model is its simple-to-implement and highly predictive final form, as needed for many real-world applications.}},

In addition, no appreciable difference in [gamma]c is observed in the dense pastes with crystalline and glassy structures which are formed by mono- and bidisperse microgels, respectively. This is in contrast to a finite difference in [gamma]c for the crystal and glass formed by the hard sphere reported by Koumakis et al. [Soft Matter, 4, 2008 (2008)]. Furthermore, the highly dense suspensions of NIPA core-NIPMA shell microgels are similar in [gamma]c to those of NIPMA microgels. These results indicate that [gamma]c for the highly dense suspensions of soft micro-hydrogels depends primarily on the kind of constituent polymer near the particle surface.

Previous studies focused on wavelength selection at the instability onset and overlooked the striking features appearing more globally. Here we investigate the non-linear growth that occurs after the instability has been fully established. We find a rich variety of patterns that are characterized by the viscosity ratio between the inner and the outer fluid, {$\eta$}in/{$\eta$}out, as distinct from the most-unstable wavelength, which determines the onset of the instability. As {$\eta$}in/{$\eta$}out increases, a regime dominated by long highly-branched fractal fingers gives way to one dominated by blunt stable structures characteristic of proportionate growth. Simultaneously, a central region of complete outer-fluid displacement grows until it encompasses the entire pattern at {$\eta$}in/{$\eta$}out{$\approx$}0.3.}},

	Abstract = {{Abstract Soft materials can experience a mechanical instability when subjected to a finite compression, developing wrinkles which may eventually evolve into folds or creases. The possibility to control the wrinkling network morphology has recently found several applications in many developing fields, such as scaffolds for biomaterials, stretchable electronics and surface micro-fabrication. Albeit much is known of the pattern initiation at the linear stability order, the nonlinear effects driving the pattern selection in soft materials are still unknown. This work aims at investigating the nature of the elastic bifurcation undertaken by a growing soft layer subjected to a equi-biaxial strain. Considering a skin effect at the free surface, the instability thresholds are found to be controlled by a characteristic length, defined by the ratio between capillary energy and bulk elasticity. For the first time, a weakly nonlinear analysis of the wrinkling instability is performed here using the multiple-scale perturbation method applied to the incremental theory in finite elasticity. The Ginzburg{--}Landau equations are derived for different superposing linear modes. This study proves that a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation drives the observed wrinkle-to-fold transition in swelling gels experiments, favoring the emergence of hexagonal creased patterns, albeit quasi-hexagonal patterns might later emerge because of an expected symmetry break. Moreover, if the surface energy is somewhat comparable to the bulk elastic energy, it has the same stabilizing effect as for fluid instabilities, driving the formation of stable wrinkles, as observed in elastic bi-layered materials. }},

	Abstract = {{Interfaces involving coexisting phases in condensed matter are essential in many phenomena: wetting, nucleation, morphology, phase separation kinetics, membranes, phase coexistence in nanomaterials, etc. The majority of analytical theories available use concepts derived from mean field artifacts which do not describe adequately these systems. Satisfactory numerical simulation of interfaces at the atomistic to mesoscopic scale is still a challenge. In the present work, the interfacial tension between mixtures of organic solvents and water is obtained from mesoscopic computer simulations. The temperature dependence of the interfacial tension is found to obey a scaling law with an average critical exponent [small mu ] = 1.23. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the correlation length, defined as the thickness of the interface between the immiscible fluids, as a function of temperature and find that it obeys also a scaling law with an average critical exponent being [small nu] = 0.67. Finally, we show that the comparison of [small mu ] and [small nu] for these binary mixtures constitutes the first test of Widom{'}s hyperscaling relationship between these exponents in 3d, expressed as [small mu ] = [small nu] (d - 1). Based on these values and those for the 3d Ising model it is argued that both systems belong to the same universality class, which opens up the way for the calculation of new scaling exponents.}},

	Abstract = {{We have developed a fast simulation that generates a random walk of an isolated probe sphere in a generalized linear viscoelastic complex fluid over a highly extended dynamic range. We introduce a coupled harmonically bound Brownian particle (c-HBBP) model, in which the relaxation modes of the viscoelastic medium are treated as harmonic wells. These wells are coupled to the probe sphere and perform Brownian motion in bound harmonic potentials corresponding to the next-longer relaxation mode, according to the relaxation spectrum of the viscoelastic material. We implement this c-HBBP model by generating variable temporal step sizes that have a uniform distribution in logarithmic time. We create and analyze trajectories for several different viscoelastic complex fluids: a polymer system at its gel point, a dense emulsion system, a blend of two monodisperse polystyrene polymers for which the relaxation spectrum has been measured, and a model anisotropic soft system that shows dense emulsion-like and gel-point behaviors along two orthogonal directions. Except for unusual viscoelastic materials, such as the polymer system at its gel point, the generated trajectories are neither self-similar nor self-affine. The resulting mean square displacements predicted by the c-HBBP model are consistent with the single-particle generalized Stokes-Einstein relation of linear passive microrheology.}},

	Abstract = {{Thin polymer films have striking dynamical properties that differ from their bulk counterparts. With the simple geometry of a stepped polymer film on a substrate, we probe mobility above and below the glass transition temperature Tg. Above Tg the entire film flows, whereas below Tg only the near-surface region responds to the excess interfacial energy. An analytical thin-film model for flow limited to the free surface region shows excellent agreement with sub-Tg data. The system transitions from whole-film flow to surface localized flow over a narrow temperature region near the bulk Tg. The experiments and model provide a measure of surface mobility in a simple geometry where confinement and substrate effects are negligible. This fine control of the glassy rheology is of key interest to nanolithography among numerous other applications.}},

	Abstract = {{The influence of peeling angle on the dynamics observed during the stick-slip peeling of an adhesive tape has been investigated. This study relies on a new experimental setup for peeling at a constant driving velocity while keeping constant the peeling angle and peeled tape length. The thresholds of the instability are shown to be associated with a subcritical bifurcation and bistability of the system. The velocity onset of the instability is moreover revealed to strongly depend on the peeling angle. This could be the consequence of peeling angle dependance of either the fracture energy of the adhesive-substrate joint or the effective stiffness at play between the peeling front and the point at which the peeling is enforced. The shape of the peeling front velocity fluctuations is finally shown to progressively change from typical stick-slip relaxation oscillations to nearly sinusoidal oscillations as the peeling angle is increased. We suggest that this transition might be controlled by inertial effects possibly associated with the propagation of the peeling force fluctuations through elongation waves in the peeled tape.}},

	Abstract = {{Capsules having a thin alginate hydrogel membrane and an aqueous core can be obtained by a process that involves a co-extrusion step in air followed by a sol-gel transition of the shell after immersion into a gelling bath. The possibility to encapsulate cells that further grow in these biocompatible compartments, and thus offer a versatile tool for cell culture, led us to investigate the physicochemical properties of the capsules. A cut-off pore size of the semi-permeable membrane is extrapolated from the release of polymers out of the capsule. When polymers cannot diffuse through the membrane, the osmotic pressure mismatch between the core and the surrounding medium triggers an inflation of the capsule. The swelling may reach a steady state that allows the determination of the elastic features of the hydrogel shell. On the other hand, the capsule membrane may rupture and then contract. From this stress-relaxation process, a critical deformation of the hydrogel shell above which plasticity occurs can be deduced. Finally, thanks to the physical nature of the hydrogel, the core content can be released by dissolving the membrane with the help of small electrolytes. The shell life is shown to vary inversely with the ionic strength of the solution.}},

	Abstract = {{Many urological studies rely on models of animals, such as rats and pigs, but their relation to the human urinary system is poorly understood. Here, we elucidate the hydrodynamics of urination across five orders of magnitude in body mass. Using high-speed videography and flow-rate measurement obtained at Zoo Atlanta, we discover that all mammals above 3 kg in weight empty their bladders over nearly constant duration of 21 {$\pm$} 13 s. This feat is possible, because larger animals have longer urethras and thus, higher gravitational force and higher flow speed. Smaller mammals are challenged during urination by high viscous and capillary forces that limit their urine to single drops. Our findings reveal that the urethra is a flow-enhancing device, enabling the urinary system to be scaled up by a factor of 3,600 in volume without compromising its function. This study may help to diagnose urinary problems in animals as well as inspire the design of scalable hydrodynamic systems based on those in nature.}},

Using rare-event sampling techniques, we find that melting of representative solids{---}here, copper and aluminum{---}occurs via multiple, competing pathways involving the formation and migration of point defects or dislocations. Each path is characterized by multiple barrier-crossing events arising from multiple metastable states within the solid basin. At temperatures approaching superheating, melting becomes a single barrier-crossing process, and at the limit of superheating, the melting mechanism is driven by a vibrational instability. Our findings reveal the importance of nonlocal behavior, suggesting a revision of the perspective of classical nucleation theory.}},

We have studied the influence of the latter two cues by mesoscopic simulations. As a result, we have found that the total friction of membrane proteins, [gamma], increases approximately linearly with the length of the extra-membrane domain, L, whereas a slightly nonlinear dependence on the total protein concentration, [curly or open phi] was observed. We provide an educated guess for the functional form of [gamma](L, [curly or open phi]) and the associated diffusion coefficient. This expression not only matches our simulation data but it is also in favorable agreement with previously published experimental data. Our findings indicate that diffusion coefficients of membrane proteins are not solely determined by the friction of membrane anchors but also extra-membrane domains and the crowdedness of the membrane need to be considered to obtain a comprehensive view of protein diffusion on cellular membranes.}},

However, no surfaces were able to repel extremely-low-energy liquids such as fluorinated solvents, which completely wet even the most hydrophobic material. We show how roughness alone, if made of a specific doubly reentrant structure that enables very low liquid-solid contact fraction, can render the surface of any material superrepellent. Starting from a completely wettable material (silica), we micro- and nanostructure its surface to make it superomniphobic and bounce off all available liquids, including perfluorohexane. The same superomniphobicity is further confirmed with identical surfaces of a metal and a polymer. Free of any hydrophobic coating, the superomniphobic silica surface also withstands temperatures over 1000{$^\circ$}C and resists biofouling.}},

Here we experimentally investigate the cage-jump motion of a two-dimensional hard-sphere-like colloidal suspension, where the volume fraction is the relevant parameter controlling the slowing down of the dynamics.

	Abstract = {{Topological constraints can affect both equilibrium and dynamic properties of polymer systems and can play a role in the organization of chromosomes. Despite many theoretical studies, the effects of topological constraints on the equilibrium state of a single compact polymer have not been systematically studied. Here we use simulations to address this longstanding problem. We find that sufficiently long unknotted polymers differ from knotted ones in the spatial and topological states of their subchains. The unknotted globule has subchains that are mostly unknotted and form asymptotically compact RG(s) [similar] s1/3 crumples. However, crumples display a high fractal dimension of the surface db = 2.8, forming excessive contacts and interpenetrating each other. We conclude that this topologically constrained equilibrium state resembles a conjectured crumpled globule [Grosberg et al., Journal de Physique, 1988, 49, 2095], but differs from its idealized hierarchy of self-similar, isolated and compact crumples.}},

	Abstract = {{Eshelby{'}s theory of inclusions has wide-reaching implications across the mechanics of materials and structures including the theories of composites, fracture, and plasticity. However, it does not include the effects of surface stress, which has recently been shown to control many processes in soft materials such as gels, elastomers and biological tissue. To extend Eshelby{'}s theory of inclusions to soft materials, we consider liquid inclusions within an isotropic, compressible, linear-elastic solid. We solve for the displacement and stress fields around individual stretched inclusions, accounting for the bulk elasticity of the solid and the surface tension (i.e. isotropic strain-independent surface stress) of the solid-liquid interface. Surface tension significantly alters the inclusion{'}s shape and stiffness as well as its near- and far-field stress fields. These phenomena depend strongly on the ratio of the inclusion radius, R, to an elastocapillary length, L. Surface tension is significant whenever inclusions are smaller than 100L. While Eshelby theory predicts that liquid inclusions generically reduce the stiffness of an elastic solid, our results show that liquid inclusions can actually stiffen a solid when R < 3L/2. Intriguingly, surface tension cloaks the far-field signature of liquid inclusions when R = 3L/2. These results are have far-reaching applications from measuring local stresses in biological tissue, to determining the failure strength of soft composites.}},

	Abstract = {{From bone and wood to concrete and carbon fibre, composites are ubiquitous natural and synthetic materials. Eshelby[rsquor]s inclusion theory describes how macroscopic stress fields couple to isolated microscopic inclusions, allowing prediction of a composite[rsquor]s bulk mechanical properties from a knowledge of its microstructure. It has been extended to describe a wide variety of phenomena from solid fracture to cell adhesion. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that Eshelby[rsquor]s theory breaks down for small liquid inclusions in a soft solid. In this limit, an isolated droplet[rsquor]s deformation is strongly size-dependent, with the smallest droplets mimicking the behaviour of solid inclusions. Furthermore, in opposition to the predictions of conventional composite theory, we find that finite concentrations of small liquid inclusions enhance the stiffness of soft solids. A straightforward extension of Eshelby[rsquor]s theory, accounting for the surface tension of the solid-liquid interface, explains our experimental observations. The counterintuitive stiffening of solids by fluid inclusions is expected whenever inclusion radii are smaller than an elastocapillary length, given by the ratio of the surface tension to Young[rsquor]s modulus of the solid matrix. These results suggest that surface tension can be a simple and effective mechanism to cloak the far-field elastic signature of inclusions.}},

Theoretical models provide explanations for this effect but with predictions that drastically depend on the nanoscale organization assumed for macromolecular crowding agents. A conclusive test of the nature of the translational motion in cells is missing owing to the lack of techniques capable of probing crowding with the required temporal and spatial resolution. Here we show that fluorescence-fluctuation analysis of raster scans at variable timescales can provide this information. By using green fluorescent proteins in cells, we measure protein motion at the unprecedented timescale of 1{\thinspace}{$\mu$}s, unveiling unobstructed Brownian motion from 25 to 100{\thinspace}nm, and partially suppressed diffusion above 100{\thinspace}nm. Furthermore, experiments on model systems attribute this effect to the presence of relatively immobile structures rather than to diffusing crowding agents. We discuss the implications of these results for intracellular processes.}},

	Abstract = {{Cell motility in higher organisms (eukaryotes) is crucial to biological functions ranging from wound healing to immune response, and also implicated in diseases such as cancer. For cells crawling on hard surfaces, significant insights into motility have been gained from experiments replicating such motion in vitro. Such experiments show that crawling uses a combination of actin treadmilling (polymerization), which pushes the front of a cell forward, and myosin-induced stress (contractility), which retracts the rear. Here we present a simplified physical model of a crawling cell, consisting of a droplet of active polar fluid with contractility throughout, but treadmilling connected to a thin layer near the supporting wall. The model shows a variety of shapes and/or motility regimes, some closely resembling cases seen experimentally. Our work strongly supports the view that cellular motility exploits autonomous physical mechanisms whose operation does not need continuous regulatory effort.}},

The study of this kind of active system was absent from conventional physics and there was a need for both new theories and new experiments. The field that has emerged in recent years to fill this gap is underpinned by a theory that takes into account the transduction of chemical energy on the molecular scale. This formalism has advanced our understanding of living systems, but it has also had an impact on research in physics per se. Here, we describe this developing field, its relevance to biology, the novelty it conveys to other areas of physics and some of the challenges in store for the future of active gel physics.}},

	Abstract = {{The clustering of proteins and lipids in distinct microdomains is emerging as an important principle for the spatial patterning of biological membranes. Such domain formation can be the result of hydrophobic and ionic interactions with membrane lipids as well as of specific protein{--}protein interactions. Here using plasma membrane-resident SNARE proteins as model, we show that hydrophobic mismatch between the length of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and the thickness of the lipid membrane suffices to induce clustering of proteins. Even when the TMDs differ in length by only a single residue, hydrophobic mismatch can segregate structurally closely homologous membrane proteins in distinct membrane domains. Domain formation is further fine-tuned by interactions with polyanionic phosphoinositides and homo and heterotypic protein interactions. Our findings demonstrate that hydrophobic mismatch contributes to the structural organization of membranes.}},

A variety of experimental techniques and biophysical models have exploited these analogies allowing the quantitative characterization of the mechanical properties of model tissues, such as surface tension, elasticity, and viscosity. The framework of soft matter has been successful in explaining a number of dynamical tissue behaviors observed in physiology and development, such as cell sorting, tissue spreading, or the escape of individual cells from a tumor. However, living tissues also exhibit active responses, such as rigidity sensing or cell pulsation, that are absent in inert soft materials. The soft matter models reviewed here have provided valuable insight in understanding morphogenesis and cancer invasion and have set bases for using tissue engineering within medicine.}},

Yet owing to the nonlinearity of the underlying stretching and bending forces, the transitions cannot be reliably predicted by current theoretical models. Here, we report a generalized Swift{--}Hohenberg theory that describes wrinkling morphology and pattern selection in curved elastic bilayer materials. By testing the theory against experiments on spherically shaped surfaces, we find quantitative agreement with analytical predictions for the critical curves separating labyrinth, hybrid and hexagonal phases. Furthermore, a comparison to earlier experiments suggests that the theory is universally applicable to macroscopic and microscopic systems. Our approach builds on general differential-geometry principles and can thus be extended to arbitrarily shaped surfaces.}},

@article{Brown2014,
	Abstract = {{Shear thickening is a type of non-Newtonian behavior in which the stress required to shear a fluid increases faster than linearly with shear rate. Many concentrated suspensions of particles exhibit an especially dramatic version, known as Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST), in which the stress suddenly jumps with increasing shear rate and produces solid-like behavior. The best known example of such counter-intuitive response to applied stresses occurs in mixtures of cornstarch in water. Over the last several years, this shear-induced solid-like behavior together with a variety of other unusual fluid phenomena has generated considerable interest in the physics of densely packed suspensions. In this review, we discuss the common physical properties of systems exhibiting shear thickening, and different mechanisms and models proposed to describe it. We then suggest how these mechanisms may be related and generalized, and propose a general phase diagram for shear thickening systems. We also discuss how recent work has related the physics of shear thickening to that of granular materials and jammed systems. Since DST is described by models that require only simple generic interactions between particles, we outline the broader context of other concentrated many-particle systems such as foams and emulsions, and explain why DST is restricted to the parameter regime of hard-particle suspensions. Finally, we discuss some of the outstanding problems and emerging opportunities.}},

	Abstract = {{Yield stress materials flow if a sufficiently large shear stress is applied. Although such materials are ubiquitous and relevant for industry, there is no accepted microscopic description of how they yield, even in the simplest situations in which temperature is negligible and in which flow inhomogeneities such as shear bands or fractures are absent. Here we propose a scaling description of the yielding transition in amorphous solids made of soft particles at zero temperature. Our description makes a connection between the Herschel{--}Bulkley exponent characterizing the singularity of the flow curve near the yield stress {$\Sigma$}c, the extension and duration of the avalanches of plasticity observed at threshold, and the density P(x) of soft spots, or shear transformation zones, as a function of the stress increment x beyond which they yield. We argue that the critical exponents of the yielding transition may be expressed in terms of three independent exponents, {$\theta$}, df, and z, characterizing, respectively, the density of soft spots, the fractal dimension of the avalanches, and their duration. Our description shares some similarity with the depinning transition that occurs when an elastic manifold is driven through a random potential, but also presents some striking differences. We test our arguments in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton model similar to those used in depinning, but with a different interaction kernel, and find satisfying agreement with our predictions in both two and three dimensions.}},

	Abstract = {{A theory of many-particle systems is developed to formulate transport, collective motion, and Brownian motion from a unified, statistical-mechanical point of view. This is done by, first, rewriting the equation of motion in a generalized form of the Langevin equation in the stochastic theory of Brownian motion and then, either studying the average evolution of a non-equilibrium system or calculating the linear response function to a mechanical perturbation. (1) An expression is obtained for the damping function {$\phi$}(t), the real part of whose Laplace transform gives the damping constnat of collective motion. (2) A general equation of motion for a set of dynamical variables At) is derived, which takes the form where is a frequency matrix determining the collective oscillation of A(t). The quantity f(t) consists of those terms which are either non-linear in A(s), t *s *0, or dependent on the other degrees-of-freedom explicitly, and its time-correlation function is connected with the damping function {$\phi$}(t) by (f(t1), f(t2)*) = {$\phi$}(t1 {$-$} t2){$\cdot$}(A, A*). (3) An expression is obtained for the linear after-effect function to thermal disturbances such as temperature gradient and strain tensor. Both the conjugate fluxes and the time dependence differ from those of the mechanical response function. The conjugate fluxes are random parts of the fluxes of the state variables, thus depending on temperature. (4) The difference in the time dependence arises from a special property of the time evolution of f(t) and ensures that the damping function and the thermal after-effect function are determined by the microscopic processes in strong contrast to the mechanical response function. The difficulty of the plateau value problem in the previous theories of Brownian motion and transport coefficients is thus removed. (5) The theory is illustrated by dealing with the motion of inhomogeneous magnetization in ferromagnets and the Brownian motion of the collective coordinates of fluids. (6) Explicit expressions are derived for the thermal after-effect functions and the transport coefficients of multi-component systems.}},

	Abstract = {{We developed a linear-time algorithm applicable to a large class of trait evolution models, for efficient likelihood calculations and parameter inference on very large trees. Our algorithm solves the traditional computational burden associated with two key terms, namely the determinant of the phylogenetic covariance matrix V and quadratic products involving the inverse of V. Applications include Gaussian models such as Brownian motion-derived models like Pagel{'}s lambda, kappa, delta, and the early-burst model; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to account for natural selection with possibly varying selection parameters along the tree; as well as non-Gaussian models such as phylogenetic logistic regression, phylogenetic Poisson regression, and phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models. Outside of phylogenetic regression, our algorithm also applies to phylogenetic principal component analysis, phylogenetic discriminant analysis or phylogenetic prediction. The computational gain opens up new avenues for complex models or extensive resampling procedures on very large trees. We identify the class of models that our algorithm can handle as all models whose covariance matrix has a 3-point structure. We further show that this structure uniquely identifies a rooted tree whose branch lengths parametrize the trait covariance matrix, which acts as a similarity matrix. The new algorithm is implemented in the R package phylolm, including functions for phylogenetic linear regression and phylogenetic logistic regression.}},

The latter is termed active microrheology , and extends the measurement of the friction coefficient to the nonlinear-response regime of strongly driven probes. In this review article, we discuss theoretical models available in the literature for both passive and active microrheology, focusing on the case of single-probe motion in model colloidal host media. A brief overview of the theory of passive microrheology is given, starting from the work of Mason and Weitz. Further developments include refined models of the host suspension beyond that of a Newtonian-fluid continuum, and the investigation of probe-size effects. Active microrheology is described starting from microscopic equations of motion for the whole system including both the host-fluid particles and the tracer; the many-body Smoluchowski equation for the case of colloidal suspensions. At low fluid densities, this can be simplified to a two-particle equation that allows the calculation of the friction coefficient with the input of the density distribution around the tracer, as shown by Brady and coworkers. The results need to be upscaled to agree with simulations at moderate density, in both the case of pulling the tracer with a constant force or dragging it at a constant velocity. The full many-particle equation has been tackled by Fuchs and coworkers, using a mode-coupling approximation and the scheme of integration through transients, valid at high densities. A localization transition is predicted for a probe embedded in a glass-forming host suspension. The nonlinear probe-friction coefficient is calculated from the tracer{'}s position correlation function. Computer simulations show qualitative agreement with the theory, but also some unexpected features, such as superdiffusive motion of the probe related to the breaking of nearest-neighbor cages. We conclude with some perspectives and future directions of theoretical models of microrheology.}},

	Abstract = {{Mechanosensitive (MS) channels of small (MscS) and large (MscL) conductance are the major players in the protection of bacterial cells against hypoosmotic shock. Although a great deal is known about structure and function of these channels, much less is known about how membrane lipids may influence their mechanosensitivity and function. In this study, we use liposome coreconstitution to examine the effects of different types of lipids on MscS and MscL mechanosensitivity simultaneously using the patch-clamp technique and confocal microscopy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)-FRET microscopy demonstrated that coreconstitution of MscS and MscL led to clustering of these channels causing a significant increase in the MscS activation threshold. Furthermore, the MscL/MscS threshold ratio dramatically decreased in thinner compared with thicker bilayers and upon addition of cholesterol, known to affect the bilayer thickness, stiffness and pressure profile. In contrast, application of micromolar concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) led to an increase of the MscL/MscS threshold ratio. These data suggest that differences in hydrophobic mismatch and bilayer stiffness, change in transbilayer pressure profile, and close proximity of MscL and MscS affect the structural dynamics of both channels to a different extent. Our findings may have far-reaching implications for other types of ion channels and membrane proteins that, like MscL and MscS, may coexist in multiple molecular complexes and, consequently, have their activation characteristics significantly affected by changes in the lipid environment and their proximity to each other.}},

A careful data analysis procedure was undertaken in which specific issues taken into account include (i) the influence of Brillouin modes on the measured diffraction pattern at small scattering vectors, (ii) inelasticity corrections that are significant for light atom systems, such as lithium, and (iii) the effects caused by the diffractometer resolution function. Data sets taken for the same liquid temperature using different incident neutron energies yield ion{--}ion partial structure factors, S II ( k ), that are in agreement within the statistical errors. The S II ( k ) are compared with previous experimental results and with the results obtained from liquid state theory and molecular dynamics methods made using several different local pseudopotentials. Finally, the valence electron form factor, {$\rho$}( k ), is estimated by combining S II ( k ) with x-ray diffraction data and the ion{--}valence electron partial structure factor, S Ie ( k ), is calculated by combining S II ( k ) with the {$\rho$}( k ) obtained from both experiment and theory. The results show that the extraction of {$\rho$}( k ) and S Ie ( k ) by a combination of neutron and x-ray diffraction methods is feasible in practice, but demonstrates a need for new x-ray diffraction experiments on liquid lithium.}},

We evaluated the spatial distribution of channels in a lipid bilayer using patch-clamp electrophysiology, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, and neutron scattering and reflection techniques, coupled with mathematical modeling of the mechanics of a membrane crowded with proteins. The results indicate that MscL forms clusters under a wide range of conditions. MscL is closely packed within each cluster but is still active and mechanosensitive. However, the channel activity is modulated by the presence of neighboring proteins, indicating membrane-mediated protein-protein interactions. Collectively, these results suggest that MscL self-assembly into channel clusters plays an osmoregulatory functional role in the membrane. }},

@article{Baddeley2009,
	Abstract = {{We have applied an optical super-resolution technique based on single-molecule localization to examine the peripheral distribution of a cardiac signaling protein, the ryanodine receptor (RyR), in rat ventricular myocytes. RyRs form clusters with a mean size of approximately 14 RyRs per cluster, which is almost an order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Clusters were typically not circular (as previously assumed) but elongated with an average aspect ratio of 1.9. Edge-to-edge distances between adjacent RyR clusters were often <50 nm, suggesting that peripheral RyR clusters may exhibit strong intercluster signaling. The wide variation of cluster size, which follows a near-exponential distribution, is compatible with a stochastic cluster assembly process. We suggest that calcium sparks may be the result of the concerted activation of several RyR clusters forming a functional {``}supercluster{''} whose gating is controlled by both cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal calcium levels.}},

	Abstract = {{Chemoreceptors are key components of the high-performance signal transduction system that controls bacterial chemotaxis. Chemoreceptors are typically localized in a cluster at the cell pole, where interactions among the receptors in the cluster are thought to contribute to the high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and precise adaptation of the signaling system. Previous structural and genomic studies have produced conflicting models, however, for the arrangement of the chemoreceptors in the clusters. Using whole-cell electron cryo-tomography, here we show that chemoreceptors of different classes and in many different species representing several major bacterial phyla are all arranged into a highly conserved, 12-nm hexagonal array consistent with the proposed {``}trimer of dimers{''} organization. The various observed lengths of the receptors confirm current models for the methylation, flexible bundle, signaling, and linker sub-domains in vivo. Our results suggest that the basic mechanism and function of receptor clustering is universal among bacterial species and was thus conserved during evolution.}},

When the interface has anisotropic curvature, the constant-contact-angle condition at the particle-fluid boundary requires a deformation of the interface. Focusing on the case of an initially cylindrical interface, we predict the shape after a spherical particle binds. We then calculate the energy of adsorption and find that it depends on the shape of the interface very far from the binding site. Turning to the problem of two adsorbed spherical particles, we predict a capillary interaction that arises purely from the deformations caused by the contact-angle condition. An analogy is made between these curvature-induced capillary forces and electrostatic forces between quadrupoles in two dimensions. We conclude with a conjectured general form for the interaction of a single spherical particle with the Gaussian curvature of the underlying fluid interface, which we compare to previous work.}},

The stochastic partial differential equations thus obtained are shown to recover the key terms argued in Ramaswamy et al (2003 Europhys.

	Abstract = {{Mechanosensitive ion channels play a critical role in transducing physical stresses at the cell membrane into an electrochemical response. The MscL family of large-conductance mechanosensitive channels is widely distributed among prokaryotes and may participate in the regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell. In an effort to better understand the structural basis for the function of these channels, the structure of the MscL homolog fromMycobacterium tuberculosis was determined by x-ray crystallography to 3.5 angstroms resolution. This channel is organized as a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane {$\alpha$} helices and a third cytoplasmic {$\alpha$} helix. From the extracellular side, a water-filled opening approximately 18 angstroms in diameter leads into a pore lined with hydrophilic residues which narrows at the cytoplasmic side to an occluded hydrophobic apex that may act as the channel gate. This structure may serve as a model for other mechanosensitive channels, as well as the broader class of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.}},

	Abstract = {{A rationale is presented for the mix of "bilayer" and "nonbilayer" lipids, which occurs in biomembranes. A theory for the L alpha-HII phase transition and experimental tests of the theory are reviewed. It is suggested that the phase behavior is largely the result of a competition between the tendency for certain lipid monolayers to curl and the hydrocarbon packing strains that result. The tendency to curl is quantitatively given by the intrinsic radius of curvature, Ro, which minimizes the bending energy of a lipid monolayer. When bilayer (large Ro) and nonbilayer (small Ro) lipids are properly mixed, the resulting layer has a value of Ro that is at the critical edge of bilayer stability. In this case, bilayers may be destabilized by the protein-mediated introduction of hydrophobic molecules, such as dolichol. An x-ray diffraction investigation of the effect of dolichol on such a lipid mixture is described. This leads to the hypothesis that biomembranes homeostatically adjust their intrinsic curvatures to fall into an optimum range. Experimental strategies for testing the hypothesis are outlined.}},

Then, by including thermal dilatation, the Vogel{--}Fulcher{--}Tammann relation is derived. Moreover, the random and string-like characters of the cooperative rearrangement allow us to predict a temperature-dependent expression for the cooperative length {$\xi$} of bulk relaxation. Finally, we explore the influence of sample boundaries when the system size becomes comparable to {$\xi$}. The theory is in agreement with measurements of the glass-transition temperature of thin polymer films, and allows quantification of the temperature-dependent thickness hm of the interfacial mobile layer.}},

	Abstract = {{<p>A repetitive crystal-like pattern is spontaneously formed upon the twisting of straight ribbons. The pattern is akin to a tessellation with isosceles triangles, and it can easily be demonstrated with ribbons cut from an overhead transparency. We give a general description of developable ribbons using a ruled procedure where ribbons are uniquely described by two generating functions. This construction defines a differentiable frame, the ribbon frame, which does not have singular points, whereby we avoid the shortcomings of the Frenet{--}Serret frame. The observed spontaneous pattern is modeled using planar triangles and cylindrical arcs, and the ribbon structure is shown to arise from a maximization of the end-to-end length of the ribbon, i.e. from an optimal use of ribbon length. The phenomenon is discussed in the perspectives of incompatible intrinsic geometries and of the emergence of long-range order.</p>}},

By studying the soft modes that appear at the dynamical temperature, we obtain an effective theory for the critical fluctuations. This analysis leads to several results: we give expressions for the mean field critical exponents, and we analytically study the critical behavior of a set of four-points correlation functions, from which we can extract the dynamical correlation length. Finally, we can obtain a Ginzburg criterion that states the range of validity of our analysis. We compute all these quantities within the hypernetted chain approximation for the Gibbs free energy, and we find results that are consistent with numerical simulations.}},

The method used is a modified version of the auxiliary field method due originally to Andreanov, Biroli and Lefevre (2006 J. Stat. Mech. P07008). We recover the correct diffusion law when the interaction is dropped as well as the standard mode coupling equation in the one-loop order calculation for interacting Brownian particle systems. It is noteworthy that despite our starting dynamical model containing the bare inter-particle interaction potential, it cancels out and the direct correlation function emerges in the end result due to our use of the correct static input.}},

	Abstract = {{Pressure is the mechanical force per unit area that a confined system exerts on its container. In thermal equilibrium, it depends only on bulk properties[mdash]such as density and temperature[mdash]through an equation of state. Here we show that in a wide class of active systems the pressure depends on the precise interactions between the active particles and the confining walls. In general, therefore, active fluids have no equation of state. Their mechanical pressure exhibits anomalous properties that defy the familiar thermodynamic reasoning that holds in equilibrium. The pressure remains a function of state, however, in some specific and well-studied active models that tacitly restrict the character of the particle-wall and/or particle-particle interactions.}},

The method consists of the Pade extrapolation of the series expansion of the free energy in powers of kappa a, where a is the lattice parameter and kappa is the Debye screening wavevector. The authors show how to recast the usual diagrammatic expansion for the interaction free energy into a form suitable for extracting the series expansion and evaluate the terms up to order ( kappa a) 6 for the simple cubic lattice. According to the resulting form for the free energy, the Coulomb lattice gas exhibits a liquid-vapour critical point. The position of this critical point corresponds quite closely to that predicted by Stell et al. (1976) for the restricted primitive model of ionic liquids.}},

	Abstract = {{A particle driven by an external force in a molecular crowding environment-a quiescent bath of other particles, makes their spatial distribution inhomogeneous: the bath particles accumulate in front of the biased particle (BP) and are depleted behind. In fact, a BP travels together with the inhomogeneity it creates. A natural question is what will happen with two BPs when they appear sufficiently close to each other such that the inhomogeneities around each of them start to interfere? In quest for the answer we examine here, via Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of two BPs in a lattice gas of bath particles. We observe that for a sufficiently dense medium, surprisingly, both BPs spend most of the time together which signifies that the interference of the microstructural inhomogeneities results in effectively attractive interactions between them. Such statistical pairing of BPs minimizes the size of the inhomogeneity and hence reduces the frictional drag force exerted on the BPs by the medium. As a result, in some configurations the center-of-mass of a pair of BPs propagates faster than a single isolated BP. These jamming-induced forces are very different from fundamental physical interactions, exist only in presence of an external force, and require the presence of a quiescent bath to mediate the interactions between the driven particles.}},

While these measures have applications in molecular biology, materials science, fluid mechanics and astrophysics, they are under-utilized because they are often considered difficult to compute. In addition, many applications involve curves with endpoints (open curves); but for these curves the definition of writhe can be ambiguous. This paper provides simple expressions for the writhe of closed curves, and provides a new definition of writhe for open curves. The open curve definition is especially appropriate when the curve is anchored at endpoints on a plane or stretches between two parallel planes. This definition can be especially useful for magnetic flux tubes in the solar atmosphere, and for isotropic rods with ends fixed to a plane.}},

By thermodynamic integration, we determine the Kauzmann, or ideal glass transition, temperature TK(c) at which the configurational entropy vanishes. This is done without resorting to any kind of extrapolation, i.e., TK(c) is indeed an equilibrium property of the system. We also measure the distribution function of the overlap, i.e., the order parameter that signals the glass state. We find that the transition line obtained from the overlap coincides with that obtained from the thermodynamic integration, thus showing that the two approaches give the same transition line. Finally, we determine the geometrical properties of the potential energy landscape, notably the T- and c dependence of the saddle index, and use these properties to obtain the dynamic transition temperature Td(c). The two temperatures TK(c) and Td(c) cross at a finite value of c and indicate the point at which the glass transition line ends. These findings are qualitatively consistent with the scenario proposed by the random first-order transition theory.}},

The contact angle ranges between two values, a maximum (advancing) angle and a minimum (receding) angle. These limiting angles are thought to be properties of the fluids and of the chemistry or topography of the solid. By contrast, we find that the value of the receding angle can be significantly reduced by altering the interface shape. Using millimeter-sized spheres coated with polydimethylsiloxane and pulled through an air-water interface, we observe that the receding angle decreases from 101 +/- 1[degree] at a planar interface to as low as 80 +/- 1[degree] at saddle- or cylinder-shaped interfaces. The angle decreases smoothly with the deviatoric curvature of the interface (a measure of the shape anisotropy) and is linked to a non-circular contact line.}},

The alkali halides are prototypes for this specific type of short-range order in relation to the nature of bonding, but the systems in question also include other monovalent and polyvalent metal-ion halides, alkali-based intermetallic compounds and chalcogen-based alloys. A viewpoint is taken in this review which gives attention to the relations between liquid and solid phase properties across melting for compound systems at stoichiometric composition. In addition, large deviations for stoichiometry can be realised in the liquid phase, to display trends of evolution of structure, bonding and electronic states with composition.}},

One is concerned with the natural short length cutoff for the continuum model for unentangled polymer blend, and another is the effects of stress induced by the concentration fluctuation in the blends of entangled polymers. Some representative numerical results on the early stage dynamics after sudden quench will be presented.}},

	Abstract = {{We propose a stochastic model equation for the density variable which is intended for slow dynamics occurring in supercooled liquids and dense colloidal suspensions near glass transitions. The equation takes the following form for the probability distribution functional P(*,t) of the density variable *(r): ({$\partial$}{$\partial$}t)P(*,t) = -D0 * dr({$\delta$}{$\delta$}*(r)){$\tau$}*(r) {$\cdot$} {$\tau$}[{$\delta$}{$\delta$}*(r) + {$\beta$}{$\delta$}H*{$\delta$}*(r)]P(*,t), where D0 is the microscopic diffusion constant, {$\beta$} {$\equiv$} 1kBT, and H* the density functional of Ramakrishnan-Yussouff type. We show that thermally activated so-called hopping processes enter in a rather essential manner here in contrast to the earlier works where such processes occurred only on extending the theory. Further use of the decoupling approximation for this model leads to the low frequency form of the well-known self-consistent mode coupling equation for the density auto-correlation function. }},

	Abstract = {{We present an analytic scheme to connect the fragility and viscoelasticity of metallic glasses to the effective ion{--}ion interaction in the metal. This is achieved by an approximation of the short-range repulsive part of the interaction, combined with nonaffine lattice dynamics to obtain analytical expressions for the shear modulus, viscosity, and fragility in terms of the ion{--}ion interaction. By fitting the theoretical model to experimental data, we are able to link the steepness of the interionic repulsion to the Thomas{--}Fermi screened Coulomb repulsion and to the Born{--}Mayer valence electron overlap repulsion for various alloys. The result is a simple closed-form expression for the fragility of the supercooled liquid metal in terms of few crucial atomic-scale interaction and anharmonicity parameters. In particular, a linear relationship is found between the fragility and the energy scales of both the screened Coulomb and the electron overlap repulsions. This relationship opens up opportunities to fabricate alloys with tailored thermoelasticity and fragility by rationally tuning the chemical composition of the alloy according to general principles. The analysis presented here brings a new way of looking at the link between the outer shell electronic structure of metals and metalloids and the viscoelasticity and fragility thereof.}},

@article{Campa2009,
	Abstract = {{For systems with long-range interactions, the two-body potential decays at large distances as V ( r ) {$\sim$} 1 / r {$\alpha$} , with {$\alpha$} {$\leq$} d , where d is the space dimension. Examples are: gravitational systems, two-dimensional hydrodynamics, two-dimensional elasticity, charged and dipolar systems. Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non additive: the sum of the energies of macroscopic subsystems is not equal to the energy of the whole system. Moreover, the space of accessible macroscopic thermodynamic parameters might be non convex. The violation of these two basic properties of the thermodynamics of short-range systems is at the origin of ensemble inequivalence. In turn, this inequivalence implies that specific heat can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble, and temperature jumps can appear at microcanonical first order phase transitions. The lack of convexity allows us to easily spot regions of parameter space where ergodicity may be broken. Historically, negative specific heat had been found for gravitational systems and was thought to be a specific property of a system for which the existence of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics itself was doubted. Realizing that such properties may be present for a wider class of systems has renewed the interest in long-range interactions. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advances on the statistical mechanics and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of solvable systems with long-range interactions. The core of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, of mean-field type models. Remarkably, the entropy of all these models can be obtained using the method of large deviations. Long-range interacting systems display an extremely slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium and, what is more striking, the convergence towards quasi-stationary states. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation. A statistical approach, founded on a variational principle introduced by Lynden-Bell, is shown to explain qualitatively and quantitatively some features of quasi-stationary states. Generalizations to models with both short and long-range interactions, and to models with weakly decaying interactions, show the robustness of the effects obtained for mean-field models. }},

Within a Langevin description we perform this calculation on the basis of a standard path integral calculation in Fourier space. The cumulant generating function yielding the large deviation function is given in terms of a transmission Green{'}s function and is consistent with the fluctuation theorem. We find a simple expression for the tails of the heat distribution, which turns out to decay exponentially. We, moreover, consider an extension of a single-particle model suggested by Derrida and Brunet (2005 Einstein Aujourd{'}hui (Les Ulis: EDP Sciences)) and discuss the two-particle case. We also discuss the limit for large N and present a closed expression for the cumulant generating function. Finally, we present a derivation of the fluctuation theorem on the basis of a Fokker{--}Planck description. This result is not restricted to the harmonic case but is valid for a general interaction potential between the particles.}},

@article{Seifert2012,
	Abstract = {{Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation{--}dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.}},

	Abstract = {{Temperature is a well-defined quantity for systems in equilibrium. For glassy systems, it has been extended to the non-equilibrium regime, showing up as an effective quantity in a modified version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. However, experimental evidence supporting this definition remains scarce. Here, we present the first direct experimental demonstration of the effective temperature by measuring correlations and responses in single molecules in non-equilibrium steady states generated under external random forces. We combine experiment, analytical theory and simulations for systems with different levels of complexity, ranging from a single bead in an optical trap to two-state and multiple-state DNA hairpins. From these data, we extract a unifying picture for the existence of an effective temperature based on the relative order of various timescales characterizing intrinsic relaxation and external driving. Our study thus introduces driven small systems as a fertile ground to address fundamental concepts in statistical physics, condensed-matter physics and biophysics.}},
