  abstract  = {Synthetic active matter systems{,} such as active colloids{,} often have complex interactions{,} which can be of hydrodynamic{,} chemical or electrostatic origin and cannot be computed from first principles. Here{,} we use stochastic force inference to learn general pair interactions{,} including transverse forces and torques{,} between self-propelled Janus particles from experimental trajectories. We use data from two experiments: one where the particles flock{,} and one where the system remains disordered. The learned interactions are then fed to numerical simulations{,} which reproduce all the experimental observables and could be extrapolated to different densities. Overall{,} we find that the radial interaction is mostly repulsive and isotropic{,} while the angular interaction has a richer angular dependence{,} which controls the behavior of the system; the transverse interaction is negligible. Finally{,} testing the symmetry relations obeyed by the inferred interactions allows us to show that they cannot come from electrostatics only{,} so that they must have a hydrodynamic component.},
